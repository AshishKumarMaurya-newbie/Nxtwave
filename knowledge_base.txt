Dissertation/Thesis

A dissertation and a thesis represent the pinnacle of academic research and scholarly inquiry, serving as comprehensive documents that demonstrate a student’s mastery of a specific subject or field of study. A thesis typically pertains to a master’s degree program, while a dissertation is a requirement for a doctoral degree. Both delve deeply into a chosen topic, presenting original research, analysis, and critical thinking. These documents demand meticulous planning, extensive literature review, rigorous methodology, and coherent argumentation to contribute new knowledge or offer a novel perspective within the academic discourse. They require adherence to strict formatting guidelines and citation styles while showcasing the author’s ability to conduct independent research and contribute meaningfully to their academic discipline. Dissertations and theses stand as the culmination of years of dedication, representing the scholarly expertise and intellectual rigor of the author.

CAREER OPPORTUNITIES

Interior design offers an array of dynamic career opportunities for creative individuals passionate about shaping environments. Graduates in this field can explore diverse paths, including becoming residential interior designers specializing in homes, commercial interior designers focusing on spaces like offices and retail stores, or hospitality designers crafting captivating experiences in hotels and restaurants. Roles in sustainable design, where professionals prioritize eco-friendly solutions, are also burgeoning. Additionally, careers in set design for film and television, exhibition design for museums and galleries, and working as freelance designers or design consultants offer exciting avenues for interior design enthusiasts. With the constant evolution of design trends and the growing emphasis on wellness-centric spaces, the field of interior design continues to expand, presenting an array of rewarding and ever-evolving career prospects for aspiring designers.

Dissertation/Thesis

A dissertation and a thesis represent the pinnacle of academic research and scholarly inquiry, serving as comprehensive documents that demonstrate a student’s mastery of a specific subject or field of study. A thesis typically pertains to a master’s degree program, while a dissertation is a requirement for a doctoral degree. Both delve deeply into a chosen topic, presenting original research, analysis, and critical thinking. These documents demand meticulous planning, extensive literature review, rigorous methodology, and coherent argumentation to contribute new knowledge or offer a novel perspective within the academic discourse. They require adherence to strict formatting guidelines and citation styles while showcasing the author’s ability to conduct independent research and contribute meaningfully to their academic discipline. Dissertations and theses stand as the culmination of years of dedication, representing the scholarly expertise and intellectual rigor of the author.

CAREER OPPORTUNITIES

Interior design offers an array of dynamic career opportunities for creative individuals passionate about shaping environments. Graduates in this field can explore diverse paths, including becoming residential interior designers specializing in homes, commercial interior designers focusing on spaces like offices and retail stores, or hospitality designers crafting captivating experiences in hotels and restaurants. Roles in sustainable design, where professionals prioritize eco-friendly solutions, are also burgeoning. Additionally, careers in set design for film and television, exhibition design for museums and galleries, and working as freelance designers or design consultants offer exciting avenues for interior design enthusiasts. With the constant evolution of design trends and the growing emphasis on wellness-centric spaces, the field of interior design continues to expand, presenting an array of rewarding and ever-evolving career prospects for aspiring designers.

Dean's Message

The School of Education, Noida International University, operates with the objective of aiming at developing the understanding of the teaching-learning process at the secondary and senior secondary school level and the competencies required by the student-teachers to make this process effective. The program enables student-teachers to engage with studies on educational issues at global, national, and state levels and develop a conceptual understanding of the role of teachers in this culturally diverse scenario. The dedicated and well-qualified faculty and committed administrative/non-teaching staff are steadfast in thought and action towards progressively achieving the Vision and Mission of the School of Education and have been instrumental in providing an inspiring and stimulating environment for holistic progress of each and every student as well as in establishing an excellent reputation for the Institute since its inception in the year 2014.

Introduction

Pharmacy is a subject that deals with the techniques of preparing and dispensing drugs. Pharmacy degrees teach students how different types of drugs affect the human body and mind and how they interact when mixed together. So, in order to successfully study Pharmacy, you’ll have to make Chemistry your friend.

Pharmacy studies will involve spending time in laboratories, researching, and learning about the chemistry used to develop medication. Some of the courses covered by this degree consist of: Pharmaceutics, Medicinal Chemistry, Pharmacognosy, and Pharmacy Practice.

Approved By

Students will learn about the fundamentals of pharmaceutical sciences. They will gain knowledge from related fields, such as Medicine, Chemistry, Biology, and even Ethics. During the final years of study, the approach will shift from theory towards practice. You will also have to do individual research projects and present your findings.

Career Scope A pharmacist's role does not end there. They conduct market research and keep track of all medicines and products by interacting with a medical practitioner and distributors for any adverse effects, reactions, allergies, and so on. Although medications are evaluated in labs before being distributed in a market, due to the complexity and diversity of human individuals, different outcomes from the same medicine might occur; consequently, a pharmacy practitioner must research and develop medicines and prescriptions at several levels. Pharmacy encompasses everything linked to your well-being, from the food you eat to the cosmetics, lifestyle products, health, and chemical items you use. Looking at the scope of Pharmacy in the healthcare industry, according to a survey report called ‘Pharmacy at a Glance 2015-2017' by the International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP), the pharmacy community is the largest contributor, with 75.1 percent of registered pharmacists employed, followed by hospital pharmacy with 13.2 percent. The services provided by pharmacy practitioners include: Improving the use of medicines: Reviewing medicines, medicines for hypertension management, directly observed treatments, short course-based medicines, medication reconciliation, and new drug development. Product-focused services: This includes compounding medicines (based on prescriptions by medical practitioners) and assembling expired medicines from a market. Public health services: This includes promoting health initiatives, vaccinations, health camps, and other health -related awareness. The World Health Organization (WHO) in India is aiming to strengthen the pharmaceutical sector, including drug regulations, volume, and trade, to facilitate the pharmaceuticals becoming crucial for India’s growth. The WHO in close association with the Government of India, controls the strengths and collaborations for improving the pharmaceutical sector. For making the WHO 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda a success, access to medicines is a critical factor. Thus, WHO India’s key strategy is to strengthen the Regulatory system that can help access quality, safe, effective, and inexpensive medical products in an unbiased manner. Moreover, WHO India is also effectively working on establishing pharmacovigilance systems by integrating public health programmes, promoting rational drug use initiatives for medical products through the National Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance, as well as strengthening procurement and  supply chain management.

In India, a sanitary inspector’s responsibilities include ensuring that a public space operates in a hygienic atmosphere.

Pharmacist In addition to dispensing medications, pharmacists advise on how to use them properly and lead healthier lives. Additionally, pharmacists do health exams, immunize patients against infections, and track how much medication each patient takes daily.

Research Officer Often known as a research officer, a researcher manages research programs to achieve particular goals. They are responsible for determining the organization’s budgets, developing procedures, and identifying research goals.

Pathological Lab Scientist Technicians at medical and pathology laboratories conduct clinical tests on samples of biological fluids and tissues to learn more about a patient’s condition or the reason for death.

Research & Development Executive Today’s medications and vaccinations result from research and development (R&D). One of the most crucial positions in the pharmaceutical sector is that of the R&D scientist. Research and development (R&D) scientists are expected to thoroughly understand chemistry and biology, conduct animal and human trials, write reports on medical findings, evaluate existing medications, and develop better formulations. These are just a few of the main expectations of R&D scientists.

Making Prescriptions to Patients A pharmacist prepares drugs for use or delivery and ensures that patients receive all of their prescribed medication. They then disperse them as needed to meet the needs of each person.

Medical Writer Medical writers translate drug trials, scientific research, and clinical data for use in regulatory presentations, medical journal abstracts, and distribution to a professional audience.

Clinical Researcher Coordinating the trial’s execution with medical professionals, consultants, or investigators. Establishing the trial sites entails ensuring each facility has the trial supplies, including the trial medicine, also known as the investigational medicinal product.

Medical Representative Pharmaceutical corporations employ medical representatives (MRs), who meet with doctors to inform them of the new medications the company has introduced to the market. They resemble marketing managers for the company’s goods. Because MRs are in charge of generating sales of produced pharmaceuticals, this is a crucial position. They must be well knowledgeable about every drug that their company manufactures.

✅ What is an Education CRM?

An Education CRM is a purpose-built solution that can empower an educational organization’s sales and marketing teams to drive more student conversions. It equips teams to be more efficient and productive by allowing them to engage contextually with prospective learners and students. It is different from a B2B Sales CRM which typically involves a long and complex cycle, used mainly by sales representatives in organizations.

A B2B Sales CRM is not designed to handle high-volume calls, data analytics, tracking, and reporting which educational organisations like Ed-Tech companies and coaching and training institutes need in today’s day and age. Our B2C Education CRM solves all these problems with its deep focus on student touchpoints and their enrolment journey. It is widely used by large call center teams & on-field sales representatives and has features like Sales Execution & Automation, Sales Tracking & Performance, Marketing Automation, and Integrated Payment Management which is a unique differentiator.

An Education Chatbot is virtual, and the smartest admission counsellor, you can ever put to work, who can convert all your inbound and advertising traffic into qualified leads by contextually engaging with them on your website. Unlike other chatbots which are built as horizontal platforms, and can be used in different industries, an education chatbot understands how the education industry functions and nurtures prospects as per their requirements.

It ensures that each conversation is unique, thus, helping in capturing and strategically nurturing the candidate with a delightful counseling experience. It can be integrated into various platforms and applications besides websites, such as WhatsApp and Facebook to provide prospective students with quick and easy access to information and support 24/7/365. Meritto’ NIAA, the specialised education chatbot has been made for educational organisations to help them grow their enrolments and the bottom line.

✅ What is an Ed-Tech CRM?

An EdTech CRM is a unified platform for student acquisition, retention, and upsell. It allows EdTech companies to get higher efficiency from their sales and marketing teams and eventually boost their enrollments and retention rates. It generally consists of features like Sales Execution & Automation, Sales Tracking & Performance, Sales Notifications, and Marketing Automation.

Unlike a generic sales CRM, our purpose-built EdTech CRM is primarily designed to super-charge Marketing Teams to attract the right audiences, run complete inbound marketing campaigns at scale, and contextually nurture leads down the sales funnel. Further, it equips the Sales Teams to drive leads to closure with powerful management, performance reporting, and notifications. What stands out is its Integrated Payment Management feature that makes it easy for sales teams to actually convert students and the management teams to track the effectiveness of campaigns.

Magazine

Dean's Message:

In a world that is heading towards materialism, we, the people of liberal studies, try to make it more humanitarian and philosophical. You’ll discover, as a student of the liberal arts, a whole new way of looking at the world with a passion to work for sustainable prosperity. A Liberal Arts degree encourages critical thinking, originality, and creativity, all of which are sought after, by employers. Because of their rarity, employers want to hang on to the creative initiatives and problem-solving talents of emerging social scientists. Values never go out of style; a liberal arts degree is becoming increasingly useful to employers even though more and more jobs are being shelled out by technology. Such exclusive talents that liberal arts serve cannot be showcased by machines.

We offer multidisciplinary education to prepare administrators, academicians, pioneers, artists, etc., to meet the requirements of the modern world. Our aim is to prepare students to face real-world challenges in a pragmatic and sensible manner.

Key Highlights of School:

School of Liberal Arts, Noida International University publishes annually a UGC CARE Listed Journal – “NIU International Journal of Human Rights.”

The school provides counselling sessions to help students.

The School also has student clubs to furnish to the academic and cultural creativity of students.

All offered courses are structured in a real-world-oriented style and provide a window into the future, in keeping an update with the globalized contemporary social needs, very soon it will implement NEP 2020.

SLA strives to ignite intellectual curiosity and a passion for lifelong learning.

The School of Liberal Arts has eight disciplines and offers Graduate, Post Graduate & PhD. degrees in all disciplines.

About School of Journalism & Mass Communication

Journalism and Mass communication are exclusive ways of disseminating information and messages to the masses through different mediums such as Newspapers, Radio, Television and Internet. While journalism deals with the process of how news-related content is being produced, Mass communication is the system of diffusing the messages to the population. As the industry grows older and wiser, the need for young & dynamic communicators and journalists becomes infinite.

The School of Journalism and Mass Communication at Noida International University aims at providing the students an opportunity to explore themselves in the profession. Its uniquely designed courses and exclusive pedagogy are perfectly blended with the varied areas as per the industry’s growing demand. The school promises to explore the core competencies of each student and would help to make them think rightly in their career ahead. Constantly exposing the students to global media culture is what we strive for.

Dean’s Message:

“Medium is the message,” as said by Marshall McLuhan, the famous mass communication theorist. Became the focal point of the media industry in today’s scenario. The media industry as a whole has a very big umbrella. Entertainment has become a part and parcel of media in recent times, making it more viable and convenient for the audience. The growth has promulgated the audience into a new arena and made them customers. The customer-based interventions have put the industry into a new perspective of competition-based growth.

The media and entertainment industry in India is one of the fastest-growing industries in the country. Its various segments—film, television, advertising, print media, music, and digital, among others—have witnessed tremendous growth in the last few years.

Although in recent times the media and entertainment industry has grown some offshoot branches in the form of Animation, Gaming, Live Events, and Music etc. It was the distant past that only television, print, and radio existed. After the coming of the internet and digitalization, and moreover, with the coming of Android-based mobile phones, the scenario has been changed drastically. The so-called palm-based technology has made the media and entertainment industry more. Competitive. The introduction of app-based media has also driven the content to be more precise and meaningful.

The focus of the school is to provide skill-based training, which is the most important part of the New Education Policy for 2020.

Dean's Message

As Dean of the School of Allied Health Sciences at Noida International University, I extend a most sincere welcome to all prospective students.

Accounting for nearly two-thirds of the entire health workforce, allied health professionals practice individually and in interdisciplinary teams to provide an extraordinary range of diagnostic, technical, therapeutic, and direct patient care. Allied with one another, as well as with medicine and nursing, the professions represented within the School of Allied Health Sciences work to improve the quality of life for patients, their families, and their communities.

Our graduates assume rewarding careers as dieticians, medical technologists, physical and occupational therapists, clinical and rehabilitation counsellors, and radiographers, among others. With such diversity, the SOAHS role is integral in transforming health care, not just nationally or internationally but also in local communities.

I am proud to support our mission and to represent the talented and diverse students, faculty, and staff who make SOAHS so vital and important. I urge you to take a few moments to explore our many programs and services.

About SLLA

The School of Law and Legal Affairs at Noida International University Noida is one of the best colleges for law and legal affairs education that provides unmatched opportunities to study law in an innovative, rigorous, and collaborative environment. Established in 2010, the School of Law and Legal Affairs, Noida International University (SLLA-NIU, Greater Noida) is a constituent unit of Noida International University founded by Maruti Educational Trust.

The School of Law and Legal Affairs promotes profound scholarship and enlightened research in law to provide the highest quality professional legal education to face the new challenges and dimensions of the internationalization of the legal profession.

At NIU, emphasis is given on not only making you academically brilliant but also true leaders and team players, thus preparing you for the real life of the legal world. Be a part of the best law and legal affairs college near you in Delhi-NCR, Noida.

Dean Message:

“If you think education is expensive, try ignorance.”

It is my firm belief that there are, in the contemporary world, challenges, socio-economic and political, that, if the legal system cannot meet them, will destroy it. These challenges are not the creation of legal professionals, nor can they be suppressed by them. They have to be met either by discarding or by adjusting our legal system. I believe that our education law should address the contemporary challenges effectively so as to adjust to the systemic needs.

In any given society, the law plays a vital role in regulating the affairs of the state, including those of corporate and business management. In our country, we have immense talent among the youth, and all that is required is to guide and bring out the best in them. The paramount thrust is to create an international academic bridge by blending the advanced knowledge and modern teaching tools with the rich traditional values, culture, and heritage. The aim can be achieved only with the support of one and all.

The School of Law and Legal Affairs promotes profound scholarship and enlightened research in law to provide the highest quality professional legal education to face the new challenges and dimensions of the internationalization of the legal profession.

“Noida International University is the best place for people who want to make the most out of their university life. Noida International University has a beautiful architectural structure. When one misses their family, the NIU Building is a perfect location to get lost. The campus takes prides in its massively amazing Central Library named as “CHARLES DARWIN” and the plus point was that NIU having the library in each and every department which help the students to enhance their skills. The Library Resources are the greatest treasure trove for reading and researching for assignments and projects. The lecturers are super friendly and patient, and the lectures are delivered through hybrid means. While exam week is a little stressful (same as exam week everywhere), the support provided by the professors goes beyond appreciation.”

ANSHIKA JINDAL

“Everything about Noida International University is great. The facilities, the staff, the location is a perfect one for students, the lecturers go above and beyond and I like how there is consistent student and faculty support especially for international students. I really love the atmosphere and ambiance on campus- it's just lovely and calm. Above all, the students' union is just the best.  I highly recommend the University for giving an opportunity to enjoy every moment (educational trip, sports meet, cultural activities, fests, etc.) and guiding me to shaping my career.”

ADITI AMBASTHA

I have been at Noida International University since past 3 years and by each passing day, I discovered the best version of myself at NIU.

College is cycle of stripped identity in which we continuously challenge our minds, step outside our comfort zones, and sometimes lapse into being lost. Without this environment, I would not have a foundation to feel grounded ever so often. Pursuing Law from school of law and legal affairs, Noida International University was the best decision of my life because here under one roof, a student can find ample amount of opportunities with academic excellence going hand in hand. Students like us get the best guidance of talented faculty members not only in academics but in all round development of a student. We get opportunities to develop our skills such as Moot courts, debate competition, Quiz competition etc. Also, we get Internship guidance, Career development classes etc. Your search for being the best will end up reaching here. "BE THE BEST AT NIU"

MESSAGE FROM VICE CHANCELLOR 

It  gives  me  immense  pride  and  pleasure  to  share  the  Abstract  Booklet  of  the  International 
Seminar on Gender and Society: A Global Perspective, organized by the School of Liberal Arts, 
Noida International University. 

The  significant  academic  gathering,  held  under  the  theme  of  fostering  intellectual  synergy 
across the humanities and social sciences, reflects the University’s unwavering commitment to 
adopt  interdisciplinary  research  and  critical  engagement  with  the  contemporary  global 
challenges,  with  reference  to  gender  perspective.  The  abstracts  covering  diverse  fields  of 
gender, witness to the depth and breadth of the scholarly inquiry that International Seminar 
inspired, an effort that brings together the voices from  diverse geographies, disciplines, and 
perspectives. 

In  today’s  interconnected  world,  the  need  for  inclusive,  multidisciplinary  approaches  to 
knowledge  creation  cannot  be  overstated.  The  abstracts  demonstrate  such  approach,  by 
showcasing  research  on  gender  topics  is  theoretically  robust,  methodologically  diverse,  and 
oriented towards the real-world impact. The thoughtful contributions covered herein reaffirm 
our  belief  that  academia  must  continually  evolve  to  remain  relevant,  responsive,  and 
responsible  towards  the  gender  concerns,  not  only  about  women  and  men  but  about 
transgenders as well. 

I extend my heartfelt appreciation to all the scholars, researchers, educators, and peer reviewers 
who have made this publication possible. My special thanks to the editorial team and the School 
of Liberal Arts for their vision and dedication, for presenting this critical work to the global 
academic community. I wish them all success for getting the related articles and getting them 
published to the standard research platforms. 

As you explore the pages of this booklet, I invite you to engage deeply in the ideas presented 
and  to  carry  forward  the  spirit  of  inquest,  collaboration,  and  innovation  that  defines 
International Seminar on Gender and Society: A Global Perspective. 

Warm Regards, 

Prof. (Dr.) Uma Bhardwaj 

Vice Chancellor

MESSAGE FROM EDITOR 

On  behalf  of  School  of  Liberal  Arts,  I  am  feeling  virtuous  to  present  this  abstract  booklet  having 
Abstracts of the papers to be presented in the International Seminar on “Gender & Society: A Global 
Perspective.”  The  Seminar  brings  together  a  diverse  group  of  scholars,  researchers,  activists,  and 
students from around the world to engage in critical conversations revolving around gender identity, 
equity, and the complex social structures that shape lived experiences. 

This seminar aims to explore these intersections through a wide range of perspectives like academic, 
personal, cultural, political, etc. shedding light on both persistent challenges and emerging possibilities. 

The abstracts compiled here represent a rich assemblage of research and reflection. They span topics 
from  gender-based  violence,  labour  inequalities,  and  reproductive  rights  to  queer  identities,  media 
representation, and transnational feminism. Each contribution is a testament to the ongoing efforts to 
challenge normative frameworks and to reimagine more inclusive, just, and equitable societies. 

We  hope  this  collection  not  only  informs  but  also  inspires  deeper  dialogue,  critical  thinking,  and 
collective  action.  We  extend  our  sincere  thanks  to  all  participants  and  contributors  whose  work 
continues to push boundaries and expand the global conversation on gender and society. I am thankful 
to our Chief Guest and Keynote Speakers for accepting our invitation and giving the participants an 
opportunity to have various perspectives on Gender studies and issues. 

With Regards!

Abstract:  The  representation  of  women’s  anger  and  violence  in  cinema  has  often  been  caught  between  two 
extremes- either demonized as villainy or justified as an act of moral justice. While male violence is normalized 
or even glorified on screen, women’s acts of rage are frequently read as either excessive villainy or as desperate 
attempts at justice. This paper aims to examine Maargan (2025), an Indian Tamil-language supernatural crime 
thriller film that reimagines female rage through the character of Vennila, a woman whose violent choices unsettle 
both the audience and the narrative itself. She is neither celebrated nor condemned outright; instead, she is framed 
in ways that force the audience to confront their own unease about women who transgress through violence. The 
study  argues  that  her  character  illustrates  the  contradictions  at  the  heart  of  dark  feminism:  the  desire  for 
empowerment through destructive means, and the simultaneous fear that such actions may reinforce patriarchal 
readings of women as dangerous or unstable. This paper draws upon feminist film theory- to analyse how these 
tensions are staged on screen, trauma studies- particularly as outlined by Cathy Caruth, provides another critical 
entry point, since violence in cinema often emerges as an aftershock of unresolved pain, where traumatic memory 
returns in fragmented and sometimes destructive ways, and Dark feminism that insists on acknowledging women’s 
anger,  vengeance,  and  destructive  impulses  as  legitimate  responses  to  systemic  oppression.  Ultimately,  by 
combining these perspectives, the framework highlights how the film positions Vennila not simply as a victim of 
trauma or an agent of empowerment, but as a troubling figure who unsettles conventional categories of villain, 
vigilante, and heroine. In doing so, Maargan (2025) opens a necessary dialogue about rage, morality, and women’s 
shifting roles in contemporary cinema. 

Keywords: Dark feminism, Patriarchal Structures, Cinematic Violence, Trauma, Revenge 

2. Women Oriented Laws and their Inter section with men's Legal Rights: A Critical 
Reflection 

Kalpna Sharma 

IFTM University, Moradabad, U. P. 

Gmail: kalpnasharmallb@gmail.com 

Abstract:  The  formulation  of  women-centric  legislations  in  India  reflects  a  constitutional  vision  of  removing 
barriers of discrimination and violence based on gender. Anchored in Articles 14, 15, and 21 of the Constitution, 
these measures aim to ensure equality and dignity for every citizen. To counter long-standing social disadvantages 
experienced  by  women,  laws  such  as  the  Dowry  Prohibition  Act,  1961  and  the  Protection  of  Women  from 
Domestic Violence Act, 2005 were enacted, signifying the State’s intent to strengthen women’s position within 
family and society. Yet, the practical application of these laws has often sparked debate. Critics argue that while 
they empower women, they sometimes expose men to unfair treatment. Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code, 
meant to safeguard women against cruelty, is frequently cited in this regard. Instances of false allegations under 
this provision have been reported, resulting in prolonged litigation, social alienation, and professional setbacks for 
men. Similarly, rules on maintenance and custody are often interpreted in a manner  favouring women, thereby 
generating concerns about the lack of gender-neutral legal frameworks. Behind these legal and policy debates are 

 
 
 
 
 
 
real human experiences. Women continue to face exploitation and abuse, but at the same time, men wrongfully 
accused may endure severe emotional trauma, stigmatization, and reputational loss. Such circumstances demand 
a  careful  balance—ensuring  that  protective  measures  for  women  are  not  undermined,  while  simultaneously 
safeguarding the fundamental rights of men. Therefore, the path forward lies in evolving laws towards gender 
neutrality. Balanced reforms, preventive measures against misuse, and widespread legal awareness can create a 
system that is fair to all. True justice does not lie in privileging one gender, but in upholding equality as a shared 
constitutional commitment. Women-oriented legislations are vital, but their scope must be recalibrated within a 
framework that secures fairness without exclusion.

3. Intersectional Discrimination and Violence against Women and Girls with 
Disabilities: A Human Rights and Policy Perspective 

Akanksha Chaudhary

Gmail: akankshach.96@gmail.com 

Abstract: Indian women and girls with disabilities face violence and discrimination that cannot be explained by 
the rubric of gender or disability alone. Rather, their everyday life experiences are framed by intersecting identity 
factors  like  caste,  indigeneity,  age,  status  of  migration,  sexual  orientation,  and  socio-economic  status.  Such 
overlapping  factors multiply vulnerabilities  and  create  distinctive  types  of  marginalization  that  are  yet  to gain 
visibility in mainstream feminist debates, disability rights activism, and state policy-making. This paper analyses 
the intersectional violence and discrimination against women and girls with disabilities in India from a policy and 
human rights point of view. It brings out the structural hindrances in accessing protection against gender-based 
violence, justice, livelihood, healthcare, and education. The conversation highlights particular contexts, including 
indigenous women with disabilities subject to cultural exclusion, adolescent girls with disabilities at increased risk 
of child marriage and trafficking, migrant and refugee women with disabilities who fall beyond the scope of state 
protection, and LGBTIQ+ women with disabilities whose identities are erased in legal and social contexts. By 
means of a doctrinal comparison of India's constitutional protections, statutory laws, and judicial remedies, with 
international human rights commitments under the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), 
the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), and the Sustainable 
Development  Goals  (SDGs),  this  paper  argues  against  the  shortcomings  in  existing  legislation  and  policy.  It 
maintains that disability-blind gender legislation and gender-neutral disability legislation do not encompass the 
lived realities of women at these intersections. The paper ends by urging an intersectional human rights paradigm 
that guarantees representation, inclusive policymaking, and accountability mechanisms. It makes a call for radical 
reforms placing women's and girls' disabilities at the forefront, thus guaranteeing equality, dignity, and empowerment 
in law and practice. 

Keywords: Intersectionality, Women with Disabilities, Gender-based Violence, Human Rights, India, CEDAW,

4. Shaping Equitable Futures: Gender Dynamics in a Global Society 

Md Ishtiak Hossain

Abstract:  This  analysis  of  gender  and  the  global  order  is  presented  from  an  equity-based  perspective  on  the 
pressing  necessity  for  systemic  change  to  realize  transformational  change  aimed  at  a  just  future.  However, 
persistent, cross-cutting gender gaps remain across the globe, reinforced by historical patriarchy and social norms 
that define access to opportunities, positions and resources. However, the global realities today reveal that gender 

 
 
 
 
equality is a far-fetched dream within the neoliberal paradigms of society, politics, and the economy. Informed by 
feminist futures studies and gender-transformative work, this analysis highlights the need to envision the purpose 
of leadership, care, and participation in communities that transcend life based on binary gender and hierarchical 
systems. They argue for the imagination of success and power within an intersectional framework that values a 
multitude of voices, particularly those bothered by more dominant narratives. This requires an end to linear and 
competitive models that cultivate intergenerational wisdom and collective wellbeing. The global mainstreaming 
of  a  gender  lens  in  every  aspect  of  policy  is  critical  for  creating  equitable  futures.  In  countries  with  strong 
leadership  on  gender  equality,  targeted  women’s  empowerment  initiatives  are  complemented  by  whole-of- 
government approaches that ensure gender considerations are mainstreamed across the boardin changing cultural 
norms and institutional behavior. These approaches center on inclusive policy-making, ethical accountability, and 
systemic shifts in resources and responsibilities. This vision aims to eliminate systemic obstacles and instill an 
environment of support in which anyone, regardless of gender, can succeed without having to choose between 
economic  involvement,  caregiving,  or  personal growth.  The  future  we  imagine  will  be one  with  caring  skills, 
balanced leadership, and community-based governance. In the end, creating fair futures will demand not just more 
but sustained collective action that actively amplifies the voices of those who are so frequently silenced; challenges 
power imbalances; and builds global solidarity for a caste of this word where gender equity is a central plank. 

5. Digital Anxiety and Fear of Missing Out among Adolescent Girls in India: A 
Gendered Perspective on Emotional Vulnerability and Coping 

Gurinder Kaur

Abstract: The present study analyses gender specific patterns of digital anxiety among school going adolescents 
in Amritsar (India) with special reference to adolescent girls’ experience towards Fear of Missing Out (FOMO), 
emotional repercussions, academic implications and coping responses. Given the pace at which social media has 
become part of the everyday lives of youth, there are concerns regarding its impact on adolescents’ emotional 
well-being, social comparison and academic functioning with increased vulnerability for girls as they continue to 
experience  heightened  societal  pressure  in  online  contexts.  A  cross-sectional  survey  design  was  adopted  after 
recruiting  400  adolescents  (202  girls  and  198  boys)  from  several  schools.  Respondents  were  administered 
standardized  scales  on  social  comparison,  digital  anxiety,  sleep  impairment,  academic  disruption  and  coping 
behavior.  The results  indicated  a  higher  degree  of  emotional  involvement  on  the  internet,  with  girls  reporting 
higher levels of social comparison, sleep issues, and perceived social media influence. Sports, family time, and 
mindfulness were among the active coping techniques that males were more likely to engage in, which represented 
the  resilience  gap.  While  academic  disruption  was  unaffected  by  gender,  females  tended  to  internalize  stress, 
which led to fatigue and difficulty focusing, while boys externalized stress through temporary disengagement. The 
findings  demonstrate how  digital  platforms  can  exacerbate  gendered  vulnerabilities  when  interpreted  through 
feminist  viewpoints  and  frameworks  such  as  the  I-PACE  model  and  Social  Comparison  Theory.  The  study 
emphasizes  the  need  of  gender-sensitive  approaches,  with  parents,  legislators,  and  educational  institutions 
promoting digital flexibility, FOMO awareness, and emotional management techniques while providing helpful 
advice for social media use that is healthier.

6. Maya Angelou’s Definition of Motherhood: Mothers in I Know Why the Caged Bird 
Sings

Gmail: priyankaredhusingh@gmail.com 

Abstract:  Motherhood  carries  very  subjective  meanings  for  every  woman  in  the  world  and  each  woman 
acknowledges differently to its travails. Motherhood is not merely biological, but also social to a significant extent. 
Mothers in universe represent both creation and destruction for a larger good. In Hindu cultures, mothers are called 
“mata”, “ma” or “mataji” because they embody divinity in form of birthing, feeding and sustenance. In classical 
writings,  the  mother-gods  have  themselves  sacrificed  their  children  in  hoping  betterment  for  everyone.  It is 
believed that mothers feel the same pain when their child gets hurt. The epic matriarchs of Indian mythologies like 
Kaikeyi, Gandhari, Kunti etc. are a part of Indian conscience. Maya Angelou has similar stories of motherhood to 
share in her autobiographies. This research article is titled “Maya Angelou’s Definition of Motherhood: Mothers in 
I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings” and it is an attempt to scrutinize the mothering Maya Angelou received and 
gave to her family. It becomes important to study given the racial and social circumstances Angelou was born in. 
The fact that her mother, Vivian, sent Maya Angelou to stay with her maternal grandmother at a very tender age 
of 3, made Maya Angelou grow up having mixed feelings about her own mother because of the prolonged absence. 
While growing up, she did not really understand who her mother was. She learnt to love her only after becoming 
a mother herself. Until then, Maya’s meaning of motherhood revolved around her grandmother’s ways.

7. From The Atharva Veda to Modern Statutes: A Critical Legal Journey on Women's 
Rights and Superstition 

Vaishali Gupta 

Research Scholar, Amity University Uttar Pradesh 

Gmail: scholar.vaishaligupta@gmail.com 

Abstract: “Superstition is not merely a set of irrational beliefs; it is a social practice that often legitimizes the 
subordination of women under the guise of culture and tradition."  - Flavia Agnes(Agnes, 1999) A critical legal 
journey is traced in this paper from the cultural references of the Atharva Veda to modern statutory frameworks 
in India, as it undertakes an interdisciplinary exploration of the intersection between superstition and women's 
rights. Located at the intersection of gender, cultural traditions, and the law, this study aims to shed light on the 
ways  in  which  belief  systems  that  swing  between  protecting  and  exposing  women  have  impacted  their  lives 
throughout  history.  Even  though  the  Atharva  Veda  talks  about  women's  health,  fertility,  and  welfare, harmful 
superstitions like faith-based healing, witch-branding, and ritual exploitation came from misunderstandings and 
distortions of cultural practices. These superstitions still disproportionately impact women in India today. To start, 
the Atharva Veda is not seen as a book that oppresses women; rather, it is seen as a spiritual and cultural text that 
reflects the historical context's concerns for women's welfare. Following this, the article traces the legal history 
from post-independence constitutional protections of equality, dignity, and health under Articles 14, 15, and 21, 
all the way to colonial interventions like the Sati Regulation Act and sections within the Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita 
dealing  with  witchcraft-related  offenses.  The  current  state  of  law  is  analyzed  next,  with  an  emphasis  on  anti- 
superstition statutes at the state level, safeguards provided by the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence 
Act, and court rulings concerning witch-hunts and associated cruelty. This paper blends cultural insights, doctrinal 
legal  analysis,  and  socio-legal  perspectives  to  highlight  the  ongoing  struggles  women  endure  when  trying  to 
balance religious freedom (Article 25) with the need to protect their dignity and bodily integrity. It contends that 
there are still holes in enforcement, victim rehabilitation, and the harmonization of federal and state laws, despite 
the  fact  that  a  lot  of  ground has  been  covered  through  constitutional  and  legislative  safeguards.  By  proposing 
gender-sensitive reforms that address harmful superstitions while preserving cultural heritage, the paper hopes to 
add  to  academic  and  policy  discussions.  This  method  permits  a  fair  assessment  of  customs,  ideology,  and 
contemporary legislation in the never-ending fight for women's rights.

Abstract:  Indeed,  we  the  global  citizen,  it  is  mandatory  and  gives  rise  to  top  priority  concerning  about 
environmental protection. The world, today, is facing various environmental issues such as climate change, global 
warming, deforestation, melting of ice in Antarctica, rising of sea level, various types of pollution created by the 
emission of smoke into air by the manufacturing industry, release of industrial waste into the canal or river to 
pollute water and soil that are destroying the different mineral elements of water and condition of soil fertility, are 
severely created to negative impact.  What can you do to support women’s environmental action? The significance 
of  environmental  change  impacts  can  be  overwhelming,  but  the  words  and  actions  can  influence  the  tangible 
changes  in  the  societies.  Consider  the  sustainable  works  of  local  women-led  organizations,  businesses  and 
cooperatives taking action on environmental change. Empower and provide platforms for the next generation of 
champions by reading and sharing the stories and work of women and girls on the front lines of environmental 
change  action.  Joining  the  conversation  on  social  media  and  explain  how  do  you  support  gender  equality  in 
environmental  change.  The  objective  of  the  study  is  to  highlight  the  contribution  of  global  level  of  women’s 
influences in environmental protection in the era of contemporary world such as how does women influence about 
various issues related to the cause of environment in different part of the world with reference to different context 
of environmental protection. What are the various ways that the women’s have courage to show their expressions 
in  terms  of  environmental  protection?  Whether  did  they  bring  their  influences  to  the  higher  organizations 
concerning  about  environmental  protection?  This  study  will  provide  a platform  to  showcase  the  influences  of 
women’s in environmental protection.

9. Women education and imperial hypocrisy in the 19th century British India 

Vidushi Gaur 

Ph.D. Scholar, Noida International University 

Gmail: gaurvidushi9@gmail.com 

Abstract: This paper examines the intertwined histories of women’s education in nineteenth-century Britain and 
colonial  India  to  expose  the  contradictions  and  hypocrisies  at  the  heart  of  imperial  discourse.  In  Britain, 
parliamentary debates and reformist campaigns increasingly framed women’s education as a hallmark of national 
progress and moral improvement. Institutions such as Queen’s College (1848), Bedford College (1849), and later 
the  admission  of  women  to  the  University  of  London  (1878)  symbolised  this  slow  but  tangible  expansion  of 
women’s access to knowledge. In India, however, the same rhetoric of benevolence and civilisation was invoked 
to justify policies that deliberately restricted women’s education to elementary literacy, religious training, and 
domestic instruction. This divergence underscores the imperial logic by which Britain projected progress at home 
while reinforcing subordination in India. The paper is structured around three dimensions of this problem. First, it 
highlights  the  gap  between  parliamentary  rhetoric  in  Westminster  and  actual  policy  implementation  in  India. 
Thomas  Babington  Macaulay’s  Minute  on  Indian  Education  (1835)  and  Charles  Wood’s  Despatch  (1854) 
exemplify this contradiction: while framed as progressive, they either ignored women altogether or reduced their 
education  to  a  narrow,  moralising  agenda.  The  Indian  Education  Commission  (1882)  similarly  reinforced  this 
restricted  vision,  leaving  responsibility  largely  to  missionary  societies  while  absolving  the  colonial  state  of 
sustained commitment. Second, the paper offers a comparative analysis of women’s educational trajectories in 

 
 
 
Britain and India. In Britain, feminist reformers such as Emily Davies and Frances Buss spearheaded campaigns 
for women’s access to secondary and higher education, and despite resistance, progress was undeniable by the late 
century. In India, by contrast, women’s schooling remained exceptional, socially stigmatised, and underfunded, 
with only isolated figures such as Pandita Ramabai or Kadambini Ganguly breaking through structural barriers. 
This comparison lays bare the imperial double standard: Britain celebrated reformist achievement at home while 
using cultural relativism and fiscal caution to justify withholding comparable opportunities in the colonies. Finally, 
the paper situates education within the broader framework of imperial control. Missionary initiatives, including 
the work of the Church Missionary Society and the Church of England Zenana Missionary Society, illustrate how 
schooling for Indian women was designed to produce “docile wives and mothers” who would stabilise patriarchal 
households and support an English-educated male elite. This domestic ideology, shared with Victorian Britain, 
acquired a specifically colonial function in India, embedding loyalty and discipline within the most intimate spaces 
of family life. Yet, as the careers of Ramabai and others show, education also produced unexpected spaces of 
critique  and  resistance.  This  study demonstrates  that  nineteenth-century  women’s  education  was  never  simply 
about  learning  but  about  power,  ideology,  and  the  maintenance  of  empire.  By  juxtaposing  Britain’s  domestic 
reforms  with  colonial  policies,  it  reveals  the  duplicity  of  imperial  rhetoric  and  the  enduring  significance  of 
education as both a tool of subordination and a site of contestation. 

10. Hidden Victims: Gender Bias in Legal Responses to Pedophilic Crimes

Abstract: Pedophilic crimes continue to present one of the most disturbing forms of violence against children. 
Yet,  legal  frameworks  across  jurisdictions  remain  embedded  with  gendered  assumptions  that  obscure  the  full 
extent of victimisation. Prevailing narratives in law, policy, and forensic practice construct the “typical victim” as 
female, reinforcing long-standing stereotypes of vulnerability and passivity. This narrow construction not only 
marginalises the experiences of boys and non-binary children but also leads to systemic underreporting, judicial 
invisibility, and inconsistent sentencing practices. Male victims, in particular, are often silenced by societal norms 
that  equate  masculinity  with  resilience,  resulting  in  their  exclusion  from  legal  recognition  and  rehabilitative 
mechanisms.  At  the  same  time,  female  victims  frequently  confront  gendered  scrutiny  during  evidentiary 
evaluation, where credibility is undermined through stereotypes concerning sexuality, morality, and consent. This 
paper  critically  examines  the  intersection  of  pedophilic  crimes  and  gender  bias  through  a  comparative  lens, 
drawing  upon  statutory  frameworks,  judicial  precedents,  and  empirical  studies  from  India  and  selected 
international  jurisdictions.  It  highlights  how  prosecutorial  discretion,  evidentiary  thresholds,  and  sentencing 
patterns are influenced by entrenched gender ideologies, ultimately producing unequal outcomes for child victims. 
The analysis also considers the role of forensic psychology and victimology in either reinforcing or challenging 
these  biases,  with  particular  attention  to  risk  profiling,  victim  testimony,  and  pre-sentencing  evaluations.  By 
exposing these structural inequalities, the paper argues for a recalibration of child protection laws and courtroom 
procedures  to  ensure  a  gender-sensitive  and  inclusive  approach.  It  calls  for  reforms  that  dismantle  binary 
assumptions  of  vulnerability,  strengthen  reporting  and  support  mechanisms  for  underrepresented  victims,  and 
incorporate  forensic  practices  that  prioritise  the  lived  realities  of  all  children  subjected  to  pedophilic  harm.  In 
doing so, the study advances an urgent agenda for equity, inclusivity, and rigour in legal responses to pedophilic 
crimes, ensuring that no victim remains hidden within the shadows of judicial bias.

Abstract: Assia Djebar’s L’Amour, la fantasia (1985) offers a powerful reimagining of Algeria’s colonial past by 
placing women at the center of its story. Blending autobiography, historical documents, and oral traditions, Djebar 
gives voice to women who were long silenced in both colonial and nationalist accounts. In doing so, her work 
transforms history into a space where memory and resistance come together. This paper draws on feminist literary 
criticism and postcolonial theory to explore how Djebar challenges dominant narratives of history. A feminist 
reading brings to light the ways her female characters endure silence, yet use memory and storytelling as forms of 
resilience.  A  postcolonial  approach  reveals  how  Djebar  rewrites  Eurocentric  versions  of  Algeria’s  past  and 
reclaims it through women’s perspectives. By combining these approaches, the paper argues that L’Amour, la 
fantasia not only documents women’s struggles but also reframes them as agents of historical change. Djebar’s 
work  broadens  our  understanding  of  feminism  by  moving  it  beyond  Western  frameworks,  showing  how 
Francophone literature can open new paths for thinking about gender, identity, and justice. In highlighting these 
themes,  the  study  underscores  the  continuing  relevance  of  Djebar’s  novel  in  today’s  discussions  of  memory, 
representation, and the power of literature to recover silenced voices.

Abstract: Gender discrimination remains a persistent issue worldwide and is deeply engrained in both domestic 
and  workplace  environments.  In  India,  traditional  patriarchal  norms  and  societal  expectations  often  reinforce 
inequalities,  limiting  equal  opportunities  and  autonomy  for  women  and  marginalized  genders.  Gender  bias 
manifests through unequal division of household responsibilities, limited decision-making power in families, wage 
disparities,  occupational  segregation,  and  workplace  harassment  (Gupta  &  Kothe,  2024).  Despite  legislative 
frameworks aimed at gender equality, social and cultural barriers continue to challenge women’s empowerment 
and  participation  in  public  and  private  spheres  (Kumari,  2023).  A  comprehensive  examination  that  bridges 
personal  and  professional  contexts  is  necessary  to  fully  understand  the  multifaceted  nature  of  gender 
discrimination  and  its  consequences.  This  study  aims  to  assess  the  gender  discrimination  experienced  by 
individuals in their domestic settings and workplaces. Main objective includes identifying key dimensions of bias 
such as role division, resource allocation, emotional impact, workplace safety, and organizational responsiveness. 
The study further seeks to analyze gender-based differences in experiences and perceptions and provide evidence- 
based recommendations for interventions and policy improvements. A descriptive research design was employed 
using a structured questionnaire comprising Likert-scale and multiple-choice questions. The sample consisted of 
40  participants,  selected  through  purposive  sampling  to  include  diverse  genders,  ages,  and  occupational 
backgrounds.  Data  collection  was  conducted  online  and  ensuring  confidentiality  and  encouraging  honest 
responses. Preliminary data analysis reveals distinct patterns of gender bias: disproportionate domestic burdens 
on women, limited participation in household decision-making, wage gaps in workplaces, and varying degrees of 
perceived  harassment  and  discrimination.  These  findings  resonate  with  earlier  studies  underscoring  systemic 
inequalities hindering gender parity (Sharma, 2024).

India

Abstract: While examining the existing discourse of ‘honour crimes’, the article addresses the question of familial 
and community violence against individuals for their courtship or marriage in India. Based on the extensive and 
in–depth qualitative field research of selected twelve villages in the state of Haryana (India), the research provides 
a comprehensive understanding of violence by highlighting multiple actors, processes, forms, and dimensions of 
such violence. The research findings point to the contextual and structural nature of such violence and the shifting 
understanding  of  masculine  identities  and  roles.  The  study  enriches  the  existing  discourse  of  masculinity  by 
throwing  light  on  the  constant  interplay  ‘crisis  of  masculinity’  in  the  private  and  public  sphere  and  ensuing 
violence.  While  recognizing  the  dynamism  and  complexity  of  masculine  behavior,  the  study  unfolds  how  the 
structural  problem  of  unemployment  and  male  marriage  squeeze  and  power  reversal  can  lead  to  a  crisis  of 
masculinity in the private sphere and ‘masculine’ assertion through violence at the community level. Again, in the 
cases where violence is inflicted by the male family members in the private realm, the community always remains 
a symbolic audience. The constant invalidation of such men for their inability to control the sexualities of their 
female  family  members  by  ‘hegemonic’  men  in  the  community  leads  to  violence  against  women  which  is 
conceived as an act of redemption. Hence, the article unfolds various nuances of patriarchal control of the sexuality 
of individuals and its challenges, shifting understanding of masculinity and the nature of gendered violence in 
India in the context of choice marriage or courtship. 

Keywords: Masculine, crisis, violence, gender, community. 

14. Gendered Dimensions of Cyber Abuse and Cyber Security in India

Abstract: The rise of digital technologies in India has transformed social interaction, communication, and access 
to opportunities. However, this digital expansion has also intensified the prevalence of cyberabuse, particularly 
against women and marginalized genders. Cyberabuse manifests in diverse forms such as cyberstalking, trolling, 
doxxing, non-consensual dissemination of intimate images, deepfake pornography, and gender-based hate speech. 
These  harms  go  beyond  immediate  psychological  distress,  often  silencing  victims,  eroding  trust  in  digital 
platforms, and restricting women’s participation in public discourse. The gendered nature of cyberabuse highlights 
deep-rooted  social  inequalities  that  have  extended  into  cyberspace,  making  cybersecurity  not  only  a  technical 
necessity but also a gendered concern. India has introduced several legal and institutional measures to address 
online abuse, including provisions under the Information Technology Act, 2000, and BNS, along with mechanisms 
such as the National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal. Despite these frameworks, challenges persist due to gaps in 
enforcement, a lack of gender sensitivity among law enforcement agencies, underreporting driven by stigma, and 
limited awareness of digital rights. Moreover, rapid technological advancements such as artificial intelligence- 
driven deepfakes and anonymous online spaces create complex threats that existing legal tools struggle to address. 
Cybersecurity in India has predominantly been interpreted through the scope of national security, data privacy, 
and the resilience of infrastructure. Nonetheless, there is an urgent need to expand this viewpoint by Integrating a 
gender-sensitive  approach  that  acknowledges  and  addresses  the  distinct  vulnerabilities  that  women  and 
marginalized  genders  encounter  online.  This  paper  provides  a  critical  analysis  of  the  interplay  between 
cyberabuse,  gender,  and  cybersecurity  in  India,  exploring  current  challenges  and  responses  while  suggesting 
strategies  for  creating  an  inclusive  and  resilient  digital  environment.  Situating  cybersecurity  within  a  gender- 
centric  dialogue  emphasizes  the  importance  of  comprehensive  approaches  that  merge  legal  frameworks, 

 
 
technological progress, educational efforts, and societal awareness to tackle cyber abuse and encourage equitable 
participation in India’s digital future.

Abstract: Forfeiture of existentialism in Arun Joshi’s; The Strange Case of Billy Biswas and The Last Labyrinth 
concerns about the society which has forgotten their culture, traditions and religious values and separated them 
with their own religion, they have put themselves into the new modern separate world, simultaneously, it works 
upon  how  atheism  leads  a  person  to  the  path  of  existential  crisis  and  bit  irritated  from  their  own  lives.  The 
protagonist emerges as an emblematic figure whose repeated encounters with joblessness, rejection, and familial 
pressures  give  rise  to  frustration  and  disillusionment,  mirroring  the  collective  consciousness  of  a  generation 
burdened with shattered aspirations. The study applies qualitative methods of literary analysis, examining how 
Gangopadhyay’s text reflects socio-economic realities such as mass unemployment, migration, corruption, and 
the widening gap between personal ambition and societal expectation. The research also explores how the text 
negotiates  issues  of  gender  and  changing  roles,  particularly  through  the  feminine  figure  which  represents 
independence  and  the  shifting  position  of  women  in  a  patriarchal  society.  The  analysis  demonstrates  that 
Pratidwandi  is  more  than  a  personal  story;  it  is  a  sociopolitical  commentary  on  postcolonial  India,  where 
unemployment  not  only  shaped  economic  conditions  but  also  destabilized  emotional  well-being,  fantasies  of 
rebellion—symbolizes a form of resistance against both structural oppression and the erosion of values. The novel 
thus situates anger as both a destructive and constructive force: while it often leads to impulsive outbursts, it also 
exposes the urgent need for social and political reforms. The research further considers Satyajit Ray’s cinematic 
adaptation of the novel, which expanded its reach and emphasized its realism by depicting everyday struggles 
such  as  poverty,  rationing,  and  the  refugee  crisis.  Through  this,  the  study  underscores  the  interplay  between 
literature and cinema in shaping public discourse about youth identity and anger in the postcolonial context. The 
study  concludes  that  Pratidwandi  stands  as  an  enduring  text  of  realism  and  social  criticism,  offering  valuable 
insights into the challenges of middle-class youth navigating a society riddled with inequality, instability, and 
unmet expectations.

Abstract: Evolving from Feminism to Post-feminism: Mapping Women’s Agency in Manju Kapur’s Novels Dr. 
Sapna Sharma Assistant Professor, Amity School of Liberal Arts Amity University Haryana Feminism began in 
the 19th century and gained momentum in the 20th century with the demand to uplift the status of women and 
secure for them various rights. It highlights the strategies by which women have been marginalized and denied 
their due rights. It addresses the political, social, and cultural ramifications of gender and sexual repression, while 
emphasizing  the  need  for  equality  between  men  and  women.  The  diversification  of  feminist  thought,  and  the 
increasing empowerment of women led to the emergence of post-feminism in the 1980s. This phase arose from 
images of strong, financially independent women. Post-feminism assumes that equality between men and women 

 
 
 
 
has  already  been  achieved  and  that feminism,  to  some  extent,  has fulfilled  its purpose. Consequently,  it  often 
regards  feminism  as  an  outdated  movement  and  challenges  its  ideological  assumptions.  While  it  continues  to 
engage with the idea of equality, post-feminism redefines it in broader terms. Equality, it argues, should not be 
determined solely based on gender. Biology is important, but it is not the ultimate criterion for equality. Men and 
women may share values or embody differences, but these are often entangled within personal identities as much 
as within gender roles. Many writers have compellingly depicted the hopes and desires, frustrations and failures 
of individuals in their literary works, especially in the novel form. Among them, Manju Kapur stands out for her 
nuanced exploration of traditional Indian families and the modern sensibilities of her characters. The present paper, 
Evolving  from  Feminism  to  Post-feminism:  Mapping  Women’s  Agency  in  Manju  Kapur’s  Novels,  seeks  to 
examine  the  shifting  images  of  women  and  men  in  Kapur’s  fiction—from  tradition  to  modernity  and  the 
postmodern era. Her female protagonists embody the idea of the “new woman,” striving to shed the burden of 
inhibitions carried across generations. At the same time, Kapur’s portrayal of men who support and stand beside 
their  female  counterparts  underscores  a  key  feature  of  post-feminism—mutuality  and  shared  agency  between 
genders.

17. Hilda as the Absent Subject: Intersectional Feminism in Marie NDiaye’s Theatre 

Jay Prakash Vishawakarma 

Ph.D. Scholar (French), Amity University Rajasthan 

Gmail: jayprakashbhu20@gmail.com 

Abstract:  The  paper  reviews  Hilda  (a  play  by  Marie  Ndiaye)  with  the  prism  of  intersectional  feminism, 
anticipating how gender, class, and race intersect to create the effect of systematic silencing of the protagonist of 
the play. Hilda, a domestic servant of working class, is never seen on scene, never heard and lives only by the 
words of other people. This dramaturgical decision makes of her what we call the absent subject, or, the body, 
labour, and identity of a person whose body is constantly negotiated yet never accorded any self-representation. 

Based on the original idea of intersectionality developed by Kimberlee Crenshaw, it holds that the case of Hilda 
cannot  be  viewed  as  either  a  case  of  gender  or  class  oppression.  Rather,  she  is  exploited  because  of  her 
racialization,  economic  precarity,  and  gendered  expectations.  The  bourgeois  employer,  Madame  Lemarchand, 
enforces a policy of domination over the looks of Hilda, her reproduction and her mood - she is forced to cut her 
hair, is told what to wear, is not allowed to have another pregnancy and is expected to remain always on a happy 
face.  These  are  the  examples  of  what  Michel  Foucault  terms  biopower:  the  control  of  lives  and  bodies  by 
authorities. Another aspect of domestic labour that the analysis shows is the fact that Hilda transforms it into a 
theatre  of  domination,  indicating  its  emotional  and  psychological  expenditures.  The  motherhood  position  that 
Hilda holds is obliterated when she is sent to a crèche to give birth to the children that Lemarchand does not have. 
The paper places Hilda in the context of the larger theatrical project of NDiaye and briefly makes parallel to Papa 
doit manger and Les Serpents where absence and silence respectively conduct the story. Lastly, the ethical duty 
to  the  audience  who  needs  to  actively  rebuild  the  subjectivity  of  Hilda  and  address  his/her  involvement  in 
structures of silencing. Turning absence into a locus of both political and emotional controversy, Hilda also makes 
the viewers reexamine the concept of equality and freedom, and encourages a further feminist vigilance that aims 
at letting the invisible seen and the silent heard.

18. Fractured Selves, Reconstructed Voices: A Psychological Reading of Living Smile 
Vidya’s Autobiography 

Shreya Chakraborty 

Shaheed Rajguru College of Applied Sciences for Women, University of Delhi 

Gmail: shreya.chakaraborty2104@gmail.com 

Abstract: I Am Vidya: A Transgender’s Journey by Living Smile is not simply a memoir but a bold expression of 
identity. Vidya represents one of the earliest autobiographical narratives of a Dalit trans woman in India. The text 
resists easy categorization: it is at once a story of pain and protest, vulnerability and defiance, stigma and survival. 

 
 
 
 
Woven through this layered narrative are four psychological frameworks that do not merely explain but complicate 
its meanings: Bandura’s self-efficacy, the Big Five’s account of neuroticism, the minority stress model, and the 
lens of post-traumatic growth. Rarely appearing as isolated milestones, Vidya’s journey through higher education, 
her insistence on gender-affirming surgery, and her reclamation of self through theatre unfold, in Bandura’s (1997) 
terms,  as  living  affirmations of  efficacy.  There  are fewer acts  of  accomplishment  than repeated refusals  to be 
undone—moments  in  which belief  in her  own  capacity  defies  the  weight  of  structures designed  to  fracture  it. 
Vidya, who duels between self-doubt and resilience, is an indicator of the traits of neuroticism as defined by trait 
theory (McCrae & Costa, 1992). This reveals intricacy rather than weakness; strength is intertwined with fragility, 
rejecting simplistic classifications. Analyzed through the minority stress paradigm (Meyer, 2003), her experiences 
become clearer: the dual constraints of caste and gender intertwine, rendering exclusion systematic and stigma 
internal, a confluence of both external and personal factors. Despite this, growth always comes from the deepest 
pit of suffering. Viewed via the framework of post-traumatic growth (Tedeschi & Calhoun, 1996), her narrative is 
interpreted  not  merely  as  endurance  but  as  transformation—injuries  converted  into  instruments,  scars 

reconceptualized as reservoirs of strength. Consequently, the autobiography is not merely a testimonial; it is a 
form of cultural resistance that reframes trans identity as both a lived truth and a political critique. This analysis 
emphasizes  the  dynamism  of  marginalized  voices  by  integrating  psychological  theory  with  literary  reading, 
illustrating how selfhood is negotiated, fractured, and reconstituted within oppressive structures.

19. Glass Ceiling v/s Glass Escalator:Different barriers/opportunities for men and 
women.

santoshiguragain@gmail.com 

Abstract:  The  concepts  of  the  glass  ceiling  and  the  glass  escalator  highlight  distinct  gendered  barriers  and 
opportunities within professional environments, significantly shaping the career trajectories of women and men. 
The  “glass  ceiling”  is  a  metaphor for  the  invisible  yet  robust  barriers  that  hinder  women  and  minorities  from 
reaching top managerial and executive positions, even when possessing equal qualifications and experience. This 
phenomenon is particularly pronounced in male – dominated sectors such as finance, technology, and construction. 
Conversely, the “glass escalator” describes the relative advantage men enjoy during career advancement when 
entering female-dominated professions like nursing, teaching, or social work. Coined by Christine L. Williams, 
the term encapsulates how men in these fields frequently receive quicker promotions, higher compensation, and 
preferential  treatment  compared  to  their  female  counterparts,  even  when  starting  with  similar  or  lesser 
qualifications.  While  existing  research  thoroughly  documents  wage  gaps,  promotion  barriers,  and  workplace 
cultures, key gaps remain. The glass ceiling and glass escalator are often studied separately, with little attention to 
how they intersect across race, class, or sexuality. Evidence beyond North America and Western Europe is scarce, 
leaving  underexplored  how  cultural  context,  digital  labour,  and  remote  work  shape  these  gendered  dynamics 
today. Addressing these gaps, this paper analyses, how these invisible barriers and boosts (Ceilings C Escalators) 
play out in different cultures and in modern job settings especially in India. It also investigates how emerging work 
models  like  remote  leadership,  platform-based  employment,  etc.  either  reinforce  or  disrupt  these  invisible 
mechanisms of advantage C exclusion. In conclusion, while the glass ceiling restricts women’s upward mobility 
in  male-centric  industries  through  invisible  barriers,  the  glass  escalator  accelerates  men’s  progress  in  female-
centric fields, reinforcing gendered disparities in professional advancement and compensation. Both phenomena 
underscore the ongoing need to address structural inequalities and to foster genuinely meritocratic and inclusive 
workplaces.

Abstract:  Throughout  history,  women  have  endured  persistent  discrimination  in  social,  economic,  legal,  and 
political  arenas.  Patriarchal  institutions,  discriminatory  laws,  and  limiting  cultural  practices  built  walls  that 
blocked women from enjoying equal rights and opportunities. From education and work restrictions to exclusion 
from  leadership  and  decision-making,  women's  quests  for  justice  have  had  long  historical  roots.  Yet,  current 
gender equality debates have also widened to encompass the plight of men. Among these are false allegations, 
custody bias in disputes, domestic violence against men, and the cultural pressure that men should be strong and 
emotionally controlled all the time. All of these issues, although less noticeable, have profound impacts on men's 

health and should be heard. However, such issues cannot be isolated. They need to be considered in the larger 
historical context where women have been subject to systemic inequality for generations. Without such a frame 
of reference, there is the danger of exaggerating men's disadvantages in a way that undercuts women's on-going 
struggles. Men might well face special difficulties, but these cannot eliminate the reality that women's struggle for 
equality is  still  incomplete in  most  societies. The struggle for  gender  justice,  thus,  should not be  reduced  to a 
competition between men and women about who are worse off. This paper argues that true equality requires a fair 
approach: ‘One that acknowledges women’s long history of exclusion while also recognising the challenges men 
face today.’ Real equality can only come from understanding the struggles of both genders and finding solutions 
built on fairness, compassion, and respect. Instead of treating gender issues as a fight between men and women, 
societies should move toward a shared vision of justice where the dignity and rights of everyone are protected and 
valued. 

21. "Trapped Voices: Postpartum Depression, Patriarchal Medicine, and the Struggle 
for Female Autonomy in The Yellow Wallpaper"

Abstract: Despite extensive scholarship on Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s “The Yellow Wallpaper” as an indictment 
of patriarchal control and its damaging effects on women’s mental health, significant gaps remain in how literary 
critics and medical historians interrogate the intersectionality of postpartum depression and the lived experience 
of medicalized oppression. Existing readings often frame the story as either a feminist critique or a cautionary tale 
about psychiatric misdiagnosis, but rarely do they address the nuanced ways the narrator’s identities—as mother, 
patient, writer, and wife—interact under late nineteenth-century patriarchal medicine, nor how medical treatment 
disregards these intersecting roles. Most notably, standard analyses frequently overlook the implications of the 
narrator’s treatment for modern clinical research, which continues to struggle with under-representation and a lack 
of intersectional consideration in its study designs. This paper addresses these gaps by offering a close reading of 
“The Yellow Wallpaper” informed by intersectionality theory, arguing that the protagonist’s decline reflects both 
a failure of medical empathy and a broader systemic neglect of women’s diverse psychological and social needs. 
By  situating  Gilman’s narrative  within  historical  practices and  contemporary  debates,  the  paper  highlights  the 
dangers  of  universally  applied,  gendered  treatments  like  the  “rest  cure,”  which  ignore  individual  identity  and 
context.  The  analysis  further  contends  that  current  conversations  about  postpartum  depression  and  patriarchal 
medicine must be reframed to recognize patient perspectives and varied social experiences, so as to avoid repeating 
the harm shown in Gilman’s work. Ultimately, this research calls attention to ongoing deficiencies in both literary 
scholarship  and  clinical  practice,  advocating  for  the  inclusion  of  intersectional  frameworks  and  patient  voices 
when addressing postpartum mental health. Such shifts are vital to achieving nuanced, effective care and fostering 
genuine autonomy for women in both literary and medical fields.

22. From Atharva Veda to Modern Statutes: A Critical Legal Journey on Women's 
Rights and Superstition

Abstract: “Superstition is not merely a set of irrational beliefs; it is a social practice that often legitimizes the 
subordination of women under the guise of culture and tradition."  - Flavia Agnes(Agnes, 1999) A critical legal 
journey is traced in this paper from the cultural references of the Atharva Veda to modern statutory frameworks 
in  India, as it  undertakes an interdisciplinary exploration of the intersection between  superstition and women's 
rights. Located at the intersection of gender, cultural traditions, and the law, this study aims to shed light on the 
ways  in  which  belief  systems  that  swing  between  protecting  and  exposing  women  have  impacted  their  lives 
throughout  history.  Even  though  the  Atharva  Veda  talks  about  women's  health,  fertility,  and  welfare, harmful 
superstitions like faith-based healing, witch-branding, and ritual exploitation came from misunderstandings and 
distortions of cultural practices. These superstitions still disproportionately impact women in India today. To start, 
the Atharva Veda is not seen as a book that oppresses women; rather, it is seen as a spiritual and cultural text that 
reflects the historical context's concerns for women's welfare. Following this, the article traces the legal history 
from post-independence constitutional protections of equality, dignity, and health under Articles 14, 15, and 21, 
all the way to colonial interventions like the Sati Regulation Act and sections within the Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita 
dealing  with  witchcraft-related  offenses.  The  current  state  of  law  is  analyzed  next,  with  an  emphasis  on  anti- 
superstition statutes at the state level, safeguards provided by the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence 
Act, and court rulings concerning witch-hunts and associated cruelty. This paper blends cultural insights, doctrinal 
legal  analysis,  and  socio-legal  perspectives  to  highlight  the  ongoing  struggles  women  endure  when  trying  to 
balance religious freedom (Article 25) with the need to protect their dignity and bodily integrity. It contends that 
there are still holes in enforcement, victim rehabilitation, and the harmonization of federal and state laws, despite 
the  fact  that  a  lot  of  ground has  been  covered  through  constitutional  and  legislative  safeguards.  By  proposing 
gender-sensitive reforms that address harmful superstitions while preserving cultural heritage, the paper hopes to 
add  to  academic  and  policy  discussions.  This  method  permits  a  fair  assessment  of  customs,  ideology,  and 
contemporary legislation in the never-ending fight for women's rights.

23. Maternal Health Care Myths in Rural Pregnant Women: A qualitative Study

saififarhana80@gmail.com 

Abstract: Women’s healthcare-seeking behaviors during pregnancy are shaped not only by access to services but 
also  by  deeply  rooted  cultural  and  social  beliefs.  This  study  was  aimed  to  address  the  cultural  views  and 
misconceptions about pregnancy care in rural women of Gautam Budh Nagar Uttar Pradesh. And further explored 
how  these  beliefs  influence  maternal  health  behaviors.  A  qualitative  study  using  semi-structured,  in-depth 
interviews with 15 pregnant women carried out in rural communities. Data were analyzed theme based and six 
major thematic areas were identified i.e., emotional and psychological beliefs including fears about fetal well- 
being  (86.6%),  stress  and  anxiety  related  to  everyday  behaviors  (60%),  and  fear  of  caesarean  birth  (26.6%); 
cultural and traditional beliefs such as avoidance of death rituals (60%), distrust in modern medicine (60%), and 
reliance on traditional healers; dietary and nutritional beliefs involving restrictions on certain foods (66.6%) and 
fears of harm to the baby (66.6%); physical activity and posture with restrictions on posture (80%), travel (46.6%), 
and general activity (46.6%); gender and social concerns including anxiety over bearing a girl child (26.6%) and 
increased workload during pregnancy (40%); and clothing and comfort where a majority of women suggested 
wearing loose and comfortable clothing (86.6%). Elder family members such as mothers-in-law reported as strong 
enforcers  of  these  beliefs  and  focused  on  intergenerational  continuity  of  cultural  norms.  Addressing  maternal 
health in such contexts requires culturally sensitive health education, community-based interventions, and active 
involvement  of  family  members,  particularly  influential  elders,  to  promote  safer  and healthier  pregnancy  care 
practices.

24. The Inimitable Legacy of Baiza Bai Scindia: A Feminist Perspective

Manjul Publishing House 

Chinimrinalini@gmail.com 

Abstract: In ‘A Vindication of the Rights of Women’ Mary Wollstonecraft wrote, “I do not wish them [women] 
to have power over men; but over themselves.” Seen as the founder of Feminism, Wollstonecraft argued equal 
rights for women. However, the word “feminisme” was used for the first time by French philosopher, Charles 
Fourier in 1837 and the word “feministe” was used for the first time by Alexandre Dumas in 1872, with reference 
to men who supported equal rights for women. France has a long-standing history of Feminist writers including 
Simone de Beauvoir, Olympe de Gouges and Helene Cixous, who defined and re-defined the word in their own 
ways  and  gave  different  dimensions  to  it.  However,  Indian  society  continues  to  boast  of  women  who  have 
continuously pushed the boundaries of what a woman should do, and made a significant contribution in the society. 
This paper is an effort to examine the role of Baiza Bai Scindia, wife of Daulat Rao Scindia, who acceded to the 
regency of the Gwalior state upon the death of her husband, under the light of various concepts and theories of 
Feminism which have evolved over the centuries. British writer, traveller Fanny Parkes wrote, “On the death of 
Scindia, by his appointment the  Baiza Bai, having become the Queen of Gwalior, ruled the kingdom for nine 
years.” However, the fierce and strong nature of Indian queens is often discussed, but the indelible mark which 
Baiza  Bai  Scindia  left  on  her  kingdom  is  seldom  brought  to  light.  Maratha  women  have  always  been  fierce 
warriors, and how Baiza Bai managed the affairs of her kingdom after the sudden demise of her husband is both, 
noteworthy and extraordinary. If her life is examined under the light of various theories of Feminism, which have 
been handed down over centuries, then her remarkable life appears more unique and arresting. In this paper, Baiza 
Bai’s life will be discussed with the help of different theories of Feminism.

Abstract: This Research paper titled “Women and Resistance in Palestine a critical Analysis Through the Lense 
of Mbembe concept of suicide bombers and Martyrdom” explores the Role of Palestinian women in the resistance 
movement against Israeli occupation through the lens of Achille Mbembe's concept of NecroPolitics, particularly 
focusing  on  Martyrdom  and  suicide  bombings.  It  examines  how  Palestinian  women,  often  marginalized  in 
dominant narratives of conflict, are effecting a transformative change by redefining traditional notions of sacrifice, 
agency,  and  heroism.  By  engaging  in  both  armed  and  symbolic  forms  of  resistance,  these  women  challenge 
established  gender  roles  and  contribute  to  reshaping  collective  identity  within  Palestinian  society.  The  study 
connects  Mbembe's  theoretical  framework  with  the  lived  realities  of  these  women,  offering  a  nuanced 
understanding of how gender and political violence intersect in the context of ongoing occupation.

Abstract: Media functions as a cultural mirror, shaping and reflecting societal values around gender. From print 
journalism to cinema, television, and digital platforms, representation in media plays a pivotal role in constructing 
gender identities, reinforcing stereotypes, and at times, offering spaces for resistance. This paper examines the 
complex intersections of media, gender, and representation through a global lens, interrogating how traditional 
and new media negotiate power, visibility, and agency. 

Historically,  mainstream  media  has  often  perpetuated  patriarchal  ideologies,  portraying  women  as  passive, 
dependent, or objectified, while valorizing men as active and dominant. Such portrayals not only influence public 
perceptions but also contribute to institutionalized gender inequalities. With the advent of digital and social media, 
however, counter-narratives have emerged—feminist campaigns like #MeToo and #HeForShe demonstrate the 
power of media as a tool for advocacy, solidarity, and global mobilization. Simultaneously, challenges persist in 
the  form  of  online  harassment,  algorithmic  biases,  and  unequal  access  to  digital  spaces,  which  reflect  deeper 
structural inequities. 

The paper also highlights representation beyond the binary, analyzing the visibility and erasure of LGBTQ+ and 
non-binary  identities  across  different  cultural  contexts.  By adopting  an  intersectional  approach,  it  underscores 
how class, race, ethnicity, and geography mediate media’s portrayal of gender. 

Ultimately, the study argues that while media remains a contested site of struggle, it also holds transformative 
potential.  Through  critical  media  literacy,  inclusive  policies,  and  ethical  practices,  media  can  move  beyond 
stereotypical constructions toward more equitable and diverse gender representations.

Ecological Degradation in South Asian Literature

Abstract: This paper explores eco-feminism in South Asian literature, examining how women’s oppression and 
ecological degradation are interconnected within the region’s cultural, political, and historical contexts. Drawing 
on the theoretical frameworks of Vandana Shiva, Maria Mies, and Carolyn Merchant, the study argues that South 
Asian  literature  offers  a  distinct  eco-feminist  consciousness  that  critiques  patriarchal,  colonial,  and  capitalist 
structures of domination. Through close readings of Mahasweta Devi’s Draupadi, Amitav Ghosh’s The Hungry 
Tide, Arundhati Roy’s The God of Small Things, and Indira Goswami’s The Moth-Eaten Howdah of the Tusker, 
the essay demonstrates how women’s bodies and ecological landscapes function as parallel sites of exploitation 
and  resistance.  Devi’s  Draupadi  embodies  the  inseparability  of  gendered  and  ecological  violence  in Adivasi 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
struggles; Ghosh’s Kusum articulates belonging to the threatened tide country; Roy’s Ammu mirrors the polluted 
Meenachal River; and Goswami’s widows reflect ecological and social decay. 

These narratives resonate with grassroots of eco-feminist movements such as the Chipko and Narmada Bachao 
Andolan, where women resisted ecological devastation through embodied activism. By situating women as both 
custodians and victims of ecological crises, South Asian literature foregrounds resistance, reclamation, and the 
urgent  need  for  more  holistic  models  of  development.  Ultimately,  this  paper  contends  that  healing  ecological 
wounds  and  liberating  women’s  voices  are  inseparable  projects.  Literature  functions  not  only  as  a  mirror  of 
oppression but also as a site of protest, reimagining just and sustainable futures rooted in eco-feminist principles.

Abstract: Phka Srapoun (Wilted Flower), a novel by the Cambodian author Nou Hach, is more than a tragic love 
story;  it  serves  as  a  mirror  reflecting  the  position  of  women  in  Cambodian  society  at  a  time  when  tradition 
outweighed personal freedom. At the heart of the novel is Vitheavy, a young woman whose beauty, modesty, and 
gentleness embody the cultural ideals of femininity. Her character represents the archetype of the virtuous woman 
who  safeguards  family  honor  through  obedience,  even  at  the  expense  of  her  own  happiness.  The  novel  also 
powerfully portrays the silent struggles of the women in Cambodia. The character Vitheavy must suppress her 
desires and accept the marital arrangements imposed on her by her family. Her endurance is revealed not through 
open resistance but through quiet suffering. An attempt has been made in this paper to illustrate how traditional 
gender expectations valued women in the Khmer society. The paper examines the space given to women for their 
personal  choices  as  compared  with  their  conformity  to  ideals  of  purity,  loyalty,  and  sacrifice.  The  paper  also 
explores the cultural expectations and societal pressures that made women endure in silence. It also touches upon 
the intertwining themes of love, duty, and sacrifice with respect to the women characters portrayed in the novel.

29. Gender and its role in Two Lives by Vijay Dan Detha: A critical analysis of an 
imposed truth turns as an eye-opener 

Dr. Ritu Sharma 

Assistant Professor, School of Science and Humanities, Department of English, SR University, Warangal 
Telangana 

Abstract: This attempt explores the nuances of the select narratives, “Two Lives” by Vijay Dan Detha that may 
be viewed through the concepts of heimlich and unheimlich. The analysis emphasis through the lens proposed by 
Freud in his essay entitled “The Uncanny” discusses the concept of the uncanny for the first time claiming that 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the uncanny: “is undoubtedly related to what is frightening—to what arouses dread and horror; equally certainly, 
too, the word is not always used in a clearly definable sense, so that it tends to coincide with what excites fear in 
general” (193). In his essay, Freud explains the idea of the uncanny precisely focusing on the concepts of heimlich 
and unheimlich. Heimlich and unheimlich are the German terms used by Freud, translated as homely (not strange 
or familiar) and strangely familiar respectively. He unravels the way  heimlich turns into unheimlich, when the: 
“concealed, kept from sight of others is revealed” (198). The narrative seems to showcase the ways in which the 
heimlich and unheimlich function in a textual universe. The major event of the narrative is the marriage between 
the two girls. The secret of identity gets revealed to the two (girls) after their marriage on their first night. Here, 
throughout the narrative, the consistent occurrence of the uncanny experiences not only changes the characters’ 
perspectives  regarding  the  gender  identity  and  its  dominance  but  also  challenges  the  concept  of  conventional 
marriage, familiar truths, values and morals, all of which constantly refer to the pluralistic nature of the universe. 
Firstly,  gender  and  its  attributed  identity  play  a  major  role  in  making  the  characters  experience  the  uncanny. 
Secondly, the reasons which make the uncanny more discernible in the narrative is the uncertainty swirling around 
the truth of gender identities of the characters.

Abstract: The play Satellite City offers a critique of the male-dominated workspace of the television industry. It 
highlights the personal and professional struggles of women navigating a career in the television industry. The 
play explores the dynamics of women in new workplaces, auditions, production meetings, and a popularity-driven 
industry.  It  focuses  on  the  experiences  of  the  female  creative  head  and  an  actress,  reflecting  the  systemic 
constraints that limit women’s agency both on-screen and behind the scenes. The play also shows how professional 
pressures affect personal identity, emotional well-being, and self-image. This study examines the play through the 
feminist  and  socio-cultural  lens.  It  also  employs  the  concept  of  gendered  labour  to  highlight  how  structural 
inequalities,  stereotypical  representation,  and  workplace  hierarchies  shape  women’s  experiences.  The  study 
analyses harassment and the exploitative nature of the TV industry as depicted in the play. It explores how social 
and power dynamics intersect in shaping women lived experiences as they negotiate between dignity and survival. 
Finally, this study highlights theatre as a space for critiquing and reflecting on broader societal inequalities and 
positions Satellite City as a significant cultural text by a woman playwright that exposes systemic discrimination 
and reimagines women’s agency.

Abstract: This paper critically examines gender discrimination as experienced by women prisoners, highlighting 
its pervasive impact across personal and professional spheres. It argues that incarcerated women face compounded 
injustices stemming from societal, legal, and institutional biases. In their personal lives, many women enter the 
criminal justice system as a result of gendered vulnerabilities such as domestic violence, poverty, and coercion. 
Professionally,  they  are  disadvantaged  before  incarceration  due  to  limited  economic  opportunities  and  face 
significant  barriers  during  and  after  imprisonment,  including  inadequate  vocational  training  and  employment 
discrimination.  The  study  explores  how  structural  discrimination  within  the  justice  system  including  lack  of 
gender-sensitive sentencing, poor prison conditions, and inadequate healthcare disproportionately harms women. 
It  also  underscores  the  intersectionality  of  discrimination,  with  race,  class,  and  other  factors  intensifying  the 
marginalization  of  women  prisoners.  The  broader  impact  on  families,  particularly  children,  is  also  addressed, 
revealing how women's incarceration contributes to cycles of trauma and poverty. The paper concludes with a call 
for gender-responsive reforms across legal, correctional, and social systems. Recommendations include gender- 
sensitive sentencing, improved prison conditions, non-traditional vocational training, robust post-release support, 
and public awareness campaigns to combat stigma. By centering the experiences of women prisoners, the paper 
advocates for a justice system that is equitable, inclusive, and truly rehabilitative.

32. Feminism in the Digital age: women's rights and the challenge of cyber abuse and 
bullying 

Lulu Nchang 

Amity University Haryana 

Abstract: The digital age has created new opportunities for women’s empowerment, giving them platforms to 
voice opinions, challenge stereotypes, and participate in global discourse. At the same time, it has opened avenues 
for gendered hostility in the form of cyber abuse and bullying. Women across the world are disproportionately 
targeted through online harassment, ranging from verbal attacks and trolling to stalking, exploitation, and character 
assassination.  These  harmful  practices  are  not  isolated  incidents  but  manifestations  of  entrenched  patriarchal 
norms that continue to portray women as inferior, fragile, or unworthy of public visibility. Cyber abuse and bullying 
not  only  threaten  women’s  personal  dignity  but  also  undermine  their  professional  participation,  as  online 
harassment frequently discourages women from leadership roles, public expression, and workplace equality. This 
intersection  of  digital  violence  and  gender  discrimination  highlights  how  stereotypes  are  reproduced  both  in 
personal and professional spheres, restricting women’s full and equal engagement in society. This paper situates 
cyber  abuse  and  bullying  within  the  framework  of  feminist  theory,  emphasizing  that  such  acts  are  more  than 
personal attacks they are structural mechanisms that silence women and reinforce existing gender hierarchies. By 
reproducing traditional  stereotypes  in  digital  spaces,  cyber  violence  undermines  women’s  rights,  dignity,  and 
participation in public life. Feminism in the digital age therefore demands a dual response: resisting the cultural 
narratives that devalue women and securing safe online spaces where equality can be practiced. Drawing on global 
case  studies  and  interdisciplinary  perspectives,  this  research  highlights  the  urgent  need  for  comprehensive 
strategies to counter digital gender-based violence. These include robust legal protections, stronger accountability 
for digital platforms, educational interventions, and collective social responsibility. Safeguarding women’s rights 
in  cyberspace  is  not  merely  about  online  safety  but  is  integral  to  achieving  gender  justice  in  the  twenty-first 
century.

Abstract: This paper critically investigates the enduring tension between the visibility of powerful women leaders 
and the persistence of entrenched patriarchal norms in modern India. Moving beyond celebratory narratives of 
historical and contemporary female success, the study employs a mixed-method approach, integrating historical 
analysis with contemporary qualitative evidence, to dissect the structural, cultural, and institutional barriers that 
restrict women’s authority and agency across public and professional domains. 

The analysis identifies interconnected challenges rooted in persistent patriarchy. Women leaders routinely face 
the mobilization of traditional femininity ideals to undermine their competence and legitimacy. In professional 
life, the glass ceiling and the motherhood penalty significantly impede upward mobility in corporate hierarchies. 
Political leaders are subject to intense, gendered scrutiny of their personal and professional lives. Furthermore, the 
pervasive "double burden"—the disproportionate responsibility for domestic and professional duties— constrains 
career advancement and the scope of influence. These overlapping societal and structural impediments underscore 
the complex interplay between gendered expectations and leadership trajectories. 

This research posits that enhanced representation and visibility are necessary but insufficient for achieving genuine 
gender parity. Transformative change mandates a dual approach: rigorous institutional reform and fundamental 
cultural  shifts  that  dismantle  the  patriarchal  assumptions  underpinning  traditional  notions  of  leadership  and 
authority. By examining the nuanced complexity of India’s experience, the study offers a comparative framework 
for understanding women's leadership in transitioning societies, illustrating how localized resistance can challenge 
global patterns of patriarchy. 

Ultimately, achieving meaningful gender equality necessitates a systemic and cultural paradigm shift that fully 
affirms  women's  agency,  expertise,  and  leadership  potential.  This  paper  illuminates  the  central  paradox  of 
women’s  leadership  in  India—the  simultaneous  existence  of  substantial  visible  progress  and  deeply  rooted 
structural  inequities—arguing  that  genuine  empowerment  requires  the  dismantling  of  entrenched  norms,  not 
merely the elevation of individual visibility.

Women had always played an important role in Indian economy right from the ancient ages in India. There are 
various evidence which refer to self supporting women who were engaged in a trade or profession. The female 
workers had to fulfill large number of duties. The association of women with productive & creative work is a 
significant feature of Indian society. A large section of women was involved in textile industry, administrative 
service, royal attendants, entertaining maids, courtesans etc. The other section of women was playing an important 
role  in  craft  occupations  &  agriculture  activities.  Both  the  groups  have  been  hardly  recognized  they  were 
undervalued when compare to men work. The invisibility of women labour force from academic writing has made 
me to write this paper which intends to focus on wages paid to women workers. The paper is an attempt to review 
whether women were paid, underpaid or unpaid. Do we find any indication towards the existence of disparities 
between the wages rates of male of female workers?

Abstract: 
Debates around gender justice in India have largely centred on protecting women from patriarchal violence and 
systemic  oppression.  While  such  protective  laws  remain  crucial,  a  parallel  discourse  has  emerged  where  men 
increasingly claim to be victims of false or exaggerated abuse allegations. This paper seeks to examine whether 
men are now entering a discriminatory zone where misuse of gender-specific laws has begun to affect their rights, 
dignity, and access to justice. 

The discussion begins with an overview of statutory provisions such as Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code 
(Section 85 and 86 BNS), the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, and the 2013 law on 
prevention of workplace sexual harassment. These enactments were framed to safeguard women from domestic 
cruelty, harassment, and exploitation. Yet, their one-sided design raises questions of balance, particularly when 
complaints are filed with mala fide intent. The Supreme Court itself has cautioned against such misuse, as seen in 
Sushil Kumar Sharma v. Union of India (2005), where it was observed that while the law must shield women, it 
cannot be allowed to become a tool for harassment. 

From a social standpoint, men accused under such provisions often face immediate stigma, loss of reputation, and 
psychological distress, regardless of the eventual outcome of proceedings. At the same time, the reality cannot be 
ignored that the overwhelming majority of cases filed by women are genuine and rooted in actual suffering. The 
dilemma, therefore, lies in reconciling two truths: the need for robust legal protection for women and the necessity 
of safeguards against the occasional misuse of these very protections. 

This paper will argue for a more balanced framework, one that neither dilutes women’s rights nor leaves men 
vulnerable to false accusations. It calls for gender-neutral domestic violence legislation, preliminary screening of 
complaints, and support systems that treat abuse as a human rights issue beyond the binary of male and female. 
By situating the issue within both legal doctrine and lived social realities, the paper highlights the importance of 
fairness, accountability, and equity in the evolving discourse on gender justice. 

Key words: Gender Justice, False Allegations, Section 498AIPC, Discrimination Against Men, Gender - Neutral

36.  Wheels of Equality: Assessment of Women’s Accessibility and Safety in Urban Public Transport in 
India 
Yash Suri 
Research Scholar, SLA, NIU 
Dr. Manju Kundu 
Assistant Professor, SLA, NIU. 

Abstract 
Urban transport systems in India are not merely channels of mobility but also critical sites where questions of equity, inclusivity, and 
safety  unfold.  Women’s  accessibility  to  public  transportation  remains  a  global  concern,  as  structural,  social,  and  cultural  barriers 
restrict  their  freedom  of  movement  and  participation  in  economic  and  social  life.  This  research  paper  critically  examines  the 
intersections of gender, mobility, and urban infrastructure. It explores how women’s commuting patterns are shaped by affordability, 
availability, safety perceptions, and systemic exclusion. 
Drawing upon empirical analysis, policy documents, and global case examples, the paper highlights that women disproportionately 
face challenges such as sexual harassment, inadequate last-mile connectivity, poorly lit transit hubs, and gender-insensitive design of 
vehicles  and  spaces.  These  issues  result  not  only  in  reduced  mobility  choices  but  also  in  broader  social  consequences,  including 
restricted  workforce  participation  and  limited  educational  opportunities.  The  study  also  underscores  that  urban  public  transport 
planning often adopts a gender-neutral stance, inadvertently reinforcing inequalities by overlooking women’s differentiated needs. 
The research adopts a multidisciplinary lens, engaging perspectives from gender studies, urban planning, and public policy. It argues 
for  mainstreaming  gender-sensitive  policies  in  transportation  systems,  such  as  improved  surveillance,  women-centric  reporting 
mechanisms,  equitable  fare  policies,  and  inclusive  infrastructure  design.  The  paper  stresses  upon  the  importance  of  participatory 
approaches where women’s opinion and transport choices are integrated into decision-making processes or urban mobility planning. 
By situating women’s mobility as both a right and a prerequisite for inclusive urban development, this paper advances the discourse 
on  sustainable  and  equitable  transport.  It  emphasizes  that  achieving  the  transport  inclusivity  necessitates  transformative  policy 
interventions,  technological  innovations,  and  social  awareness  campaigns  that  together  reimagine  urban  transport  as  a  safe  and 
empowering space for women. 

Keywords: Gendered Mobility, Public Transport, Accessibility, Safety, Urban

Abstract 

The study of folk traditions has historically been integral to India's intellectual history; nevertheless, their ethical aspects, especially 
concerning gender, are still insufficiently investigated. This paper analyses the convergence of dharma and quotidian ethics in Magahi 
folk literature—via saṁskār gīt (songs including sohar, bidaai, and kohbar), proverbs, and narratives—to investigate the gendered 
nature of moral frameworks and their negotiation and transmission throughout generations. Utilising the Bhartiya Gyan Parampara, 
the study positions Magahi oral traditions as vessels of ethical knowledge that both align with and differ from the Sanskritic canon. 

In traditional Indian philosophy, dharma encompasses not only a religious or legal obligation but a holistic ethical ideal that upholds 
societal peace and cosmic order (Radhakrishnan, 1927). Stridharma mandates chastity, loyalty, and sacrifice for women (Doniger, 
1991). 
Scholars  like  Kapila  Vatsyayan  (1996),  Dharampal  (1983),  and  Daya  Krishna  (1991)  assert  that  India's  lived  traditions—songs, 
proverbs, and tales—represent concurrent streams of knowledge that both reinforce and challenge canonical authority. In traditional 
Indian philosophy, dharma encompasses not only a religious or legal obligation but a holistic ethical ideal that upholds societal peace 
and cosmic order (Radhakrishnan, 1927). Stridharma mandates chastity, loyalty, and sacrifice for women (Doniger, 1991). Scholars 
like Kapila Vatsyayan (1996), Dharampal (1983), and Daya Krishna (1991) assert that India's lived traditions—songs, proverbs, and 
tales—represent concurrent streams of knowledge that both reinforce and challenge canonical authority. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  study  synthesizes  indigenous  concepts  of  dharma,  nīti,  and  nyāya  with  contemporary  Indian academia. The notion of loka-
dharma—dharma practised within communal settings— shapes the understanding of Magahi ethics. The research utilizes textual-
interpretive analysis of Magahi saṁskār gīt, proverbs, and stories, in conjunction with contextual examinations of performance. The 
study reveals that Magahi folk literature represents a vernacular dharma— distinct yet harmonious with Sanskritic ethics—where 
gendered morality is formulated, challenged, and experienced. 

Key Terms: Magahi folk literature, Dharma, Stridharma, Indian Knowledge Systems, Ethics

Report on Pictionary Activity organized by the Marketing Club, School of Business Management, Noida International University

The Marketing Club of the School of Business Management at Noida International University conducted an exciting Pictionary activity for the B.Com First Year students. This interactive event aimed to engage students in a fun-filled yet educational experience that tested their knowledge of branding while promoting teamwork and creativity. The activity was designed to enhance brand recognition skills and provide a platform for students to develop their non-verbal communication abilities.

Objective

The primary objective of the Pictionary activity was to improve students’ understanding of brand elements such as logos and symbols, while fostering creativity and encouraging collaborative teamwork. The event also aimed to boost students’ ability to communicate ideas visually without relying on words, a key skill in marketing.

Description of the Activity

In the Pictionary activity, four teams were formed, each consisting of five members. Students were given the names of well-known brands and tasked with drawing a representation of the brand, such as its logo, symbol, or any visual cue related to the brand, on a whiteboard. The challenge was to communicate the brand identity without speaking, allowing only drawings as clues. Team members had to guess the brand based on these drawings, and the team with the most correct guesses was declared the winner. The competition was fierce, and after multiple rounds, Team B emerged victorious, having made the maximum correct guesses.

Learning Outcomes

The Pictionary activity proved to be an effective exercise in enhancing students’ understanding of branding and marketing concepts. It helped them develop stronger brand awareness by recognizing key visual elements associated with popular brands. Additionally, the activity sharpened their creativity, as they had to think quickly and translate abstract brand ideas into clear visual representations. The teamwork aspect of the game fostered collaboration and problem-solving under pressure, helping students bond and work effectively as a unit. Overall, the students gained valuable insights into how non-verbal communication plays a critical role in marketing, particularly in visual branding and identity.

Conclusion

The Pictionary activity organized by the Marketing Club was a resounding success, providing an enjoyable and educational experience for the B.Com First Year students. Through active participation, the students not only enhanced their marketing skills but also built stronger team dynamics. The event also underscored the importance of visual elements in brand identity, leaving the participants with a greater appreciation for the impact of logos and symbols in the world of marketing.

Caffeine Chronicles”: Crafting Coffee Pamphlets

The Marketing Club of the School of Business Management organized an engaging activity titled “Caffeine Chronicles”: Crafting Coffee Pamphlets. This initiative challenged students to step into the shoes of marketing professionals, focusing on the launch of a new coffee shop. Participants were tasked with creating a comprehensive pamphlet designed to attract customers and build brand awareness. This hands-on experience aimed to enhance their understanding of marketing principles and their ability to apply these concepts in a real-world scenario, fostering innovation and strategic thinking.

The Caffeine Chronicles Activity was a resounding success, providing a valuable learning experience for all participants. The projects demonstrated a high level of creativity and strategic thinking.

NIU collaborates with OLA to upskill students; provides industry exposure through training

Noida, Aug 23, 2022: Leading educational institution Noida International University (NIU) has entered an association with EV manufacturer OLA Electric to train and upskill its students in the field of electric mobility and futuristic technologies. The university has already taken steps to collaborate with the EV major, with a joint curriculum being developed on academic-industry collaboration. As part of the association, NIU will be upskilling its students through training programs with OLA and producing skilled professionals.

An announcement regarding this was made by Dr. (Prof) Vikram Singh, I.P.S. (retd), Former DGP, Uttar Pradesh and Chancellor, NIU on the sidelines of an event Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav organised by the university in partnership with OLA to celebrate the 75 years of India’s independence. The event was also attended by Prof (Dr) Uma Bhardwaj, Vice Chancellor, NIU, Dr Parsanjeet Kumar, Pro-VC, and Rao Gulshan, Director Law Enforcement at OLA .

The event started with speeches from the Chancellor, VC and Pro-VC, and it was followed by cultural programs by students from different departments and faculties at the university. There was a lucky draw as well in which three students won mobile phones. 50 students received consolation prizes and certificates. The test drive of new OLA e-scooters at the campus was the major attraction of the event.

Dr Vikram Singh said it is a matter of tremendous satisfaction that they now have a functional association with OLA. “They have brought their electric scooters as you can see, not only for trial runs but for possible collaborations and research in future. That is a wonderful beginning. Also, OLA is a pioneer in non-fossil fuel movement. They have a plan to manufacture one million electric cars. Therefore, we are on a roadmap to a good future as far as ecosystem is concerned, conservation of valuable foreign exchange, and reducing fossil fuel,” he said.

“OLA is an upcoming Indian company and we are glad to collaborate with them. We are bringing the complete academia industry linkage here. The curriculum would be developed with the joint meeting of the academia and the industry people. We are going to give education to skilled students, so they are employable with the company. This is the initial stage and very soon we can work for the academia industry linkage in future with OLA company,” said the VC, Prof Bhardwaj.

Talking about his association, Rao Gulshan, Director Law Enforcement, OLA , said “This is a youth driven company, so we would want to encourage the youth and I think NIU is the best platform. This initiative will inculcate Make in India spirit among them. It will also boost economy and increase employment opportunities.”

Basics of Environmental studies

MODULE -1

MULTIDISCIPLINARY NATURE OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES.

Definition

The word environment is derived from the French word “environ” meaning surroundings. Hence, everything surrounding us is called environment. Every organism is surrounded by materials and forces that constitute its environment. It is the environment from where every organism must derive its requirement. The environment creates favourable conditions for the existence and development of living organisms. The survival of any organism requires a steady supply of materials and removal of waste products.

The natural environment encompasses all living and non-living things. This environment encompasses the interaction of all living species, climate, weather, and natural resources that affect human survival and economic activity. Environmental studies are multi-disciplinary because it comprises various branches of studies like chemistry, physics, medical science, life science, agriculture and public health. It is the science of physical phenomena in the environment. Environmental studies deals with every issue that affects an organism. It is an applied science as its seeks practical answers to making human civilization sustainable on the earth’s finite resources.

The environment is constituted by the interacting systems of physical, biological and cultural elements inter-related in various ways, individually as well as collectively. These elements are-

Physical Elements

Space, landforms, water bodies, climate, soils, rocks and minerals. They determine the variable character of the human habitat, its opportunities as well as limitations

Biological Elements

Plants, animals, microorganisms and human beings constitute the biosphere.

Cultural Elements

Economic, social and political elements are essentially manmade features, which constitute the cultural milieu. 1.2. Scope and imp

Scope and importance

Environment Studies enlighten us about the importance of protection and conservation of our environment. At present, a great number of environment issues have grown in size and complexity day by day, threatening the survival of mankind on earth. 1 We live in landscapes that have been heavily modified by human beings, in villages, towns or cities. But even those of us who live in cities get our food supply from surrounding villages and these in turn are dependent on natural landscapes such as forests, grasslands, rivers, seashores, for resources such as water for agriculture, fuel wood, fodder, and fish. Thus, our daily lives are linked with our surroundings and inevitably affects them. We use water to drink and for other day-to-day activities. We breathe air, we use resources from which food is made and we depend on the community of living plants and animals which form a web of life, of which we are also a part. Everything around us forms our environment and our lives depend on sustaining its vital systems.

The industrial development and intensive agriculture that provides the goods for our increasingly consumer oriented society uses up large amounts of natural resources such as water, minerals, petroleum products, wood, etc. Non renewable resources, such as minerals and oil are those which will be exhausted in the future if we continue to extract these without a thought for subsequent generations. Renewable resources, such as timber and water, are those which can be used but can be regenerated by natural processes such as re growth or rainfall. However, these too will be depleted if we continue to use them faster than nature can replace them. Deforestation leads to floods in the monsoon and dry rivers once the rains are over.

What we should implement is Sustainable Development. It is the organizing principle for meeting human needs while at the same time sustaining the ability of natural systems to provide the resources and ecosystem services upon which the economy and society depends. The desirable end result is a society where living conditions and resource use continue to meet human needs without undermining the stability of the natural systems.

The scope of environmental studies includes:

Developing an awareness and sensitivity to the environment and its related problems.

Motivating people for active participation in environmental protection.

Developing skills to find solutions to environmental problems.

Imbibe and inculcate in others the necessity for conservation of natural resources

Needs for awareness Increasing population, urbanization and poverty have exerted pressure on the natural resources and led to degradation of the environment. To prevent the environment from further degradation, the Supreme Court has ordered and initiated environmental protection awareness through government and non-government agencies. Environmental pollution cannot be prevented by laws alone. Public participation is equally important with regards to environmental protection. Environmental Education (EE) is a process of learning by giving an 2 overall perspective of knowledge and awareness of the environment. It sensitizes the society about environmental issues and challenges interested individuals to develop skills and expertise, thereby providing appropriate solutions.

MODULE-2

NATURAL RESOURCE

Introduction to Natural Resources

Any material which can be transformed in a way that it becomes more valuable and useful can be termed as resource. In other words, it is possible to obtain valuable items from any resources. Resource, therefore, are the means to attain given ends. The aspect of satisfaction is so important that we consider a thing or substance a resource, as so long it meets our needs. Life on this planet depends upon a large number of things and services provided by the nature, which are known as Natural Resources. Thus water, air, soil, minerals, coal, forests, crops and wild life are all examples of natural resources.

Classification of natural resources

Depending upon availability of natural resources can be divided into two categories such as (1) renewable and (2) Non renewable resources.

Renewable resources

Renewable resources are in a way inexhaustible resources. They have the ability to replenish themselves by means such as recycling, reproduction and replacement.Examples of renewable resources are sunlight, animals and plants,soil,water,etc.

2- Non-Renewable Resources

Non renewable resources are the resources that cannot be replenished once used or     perished. Examples of non renewable resources are minerals, fossil fuels, etc. Resources can also be classified as biotic or a biotic.

Biotic resources

These are living resources (e.g. forest, agriculture, fish and wild life) that are able to reproduce or replace them and to increase.

Abiotic resources

These are non-living resources (e.g. petrol, land, minerals etc.) that are not able to replace themselves or do so at such a slow rate that they are not useful to consider them in terms of the human life times.

Problems associated with natural resources

The unequal consumption of natural resources

A major part of natural resources today are consumed in the technologically advanced or ‘developed’ world, usually termed ‘the west’. The ‘developing nations’ of ‘the east’, including India and China, also over use many resources because of their greater human population. However, the consumption of 5 resources per capita (per individual) of the developed countries is up to 50 times greater than in most developing countries. Advanced countries produce over 75% of global industrial waste and greenhouse gases.

Planning land use

Land is a major resource, needed for not only for food production and animal husbandry, but also for industry and growing human settlements. These forms of intensive land use are frequently extended at the cost of ‘wild lands’, our remaining forests, grasslands, wetlands and deserts. This demands for a pragmatic policy that analyses the land allocation for different uses.

The need for sustainable lifestyles

Human standard of living and the health of the ecosystem are indicators of sustainable use of resources in any country or region. Ironically, both are not in concurrence with each other. Increasing the level of one, usually leads to degradation of other. Development policies should be formulated to strike a balance between the two.

FOREST RESOURCES

Forest is important renewable resources. Forest vary in composition and diversity and can contribute substantially to the economic development of any country .Plants along with trees cover large areas, produce variety of products and provide food for living organisms, and also important to save the environment.

It is estimated that about 30% of world area is covered by forest whereas 26% by pastures. Among all continents, Africa has largest forested area (33%) followed by Latin America (25%), whereas in North America forest cover is only 11%. Asia and former USSR has 14% area under forest. European countries have only 3% area under forest cover. India’s Forest Cover accounts for 20.6% of the total geographical area of the country as of 2005.

Uses of forests

Forest can provide prosperity of human being and to the nations. Important uses of forest can be classified as under

Commercial values

Ecological significance

Aesthetic values

Life and economy of tribal

Commercial values

Forests are main source of many commercial products such as wood, timber, pulpwood etc. About 1.5 billion people depend upon fuel wood as an energy source. Timber obtained from the forest can used to make plywood, board, doors and windows, furniture, and agriculture implements and sports goods. Timber is also a raw material for preparation of paper, rayon and film.

Forest can provide food , fibre, edible oils and drugs.

Forest lands are also used for agriculture and grazing.

Forest is important source of development of dams, recreation and mining.

Life and economy of tribal

Forest provides food, medicine and other products needed for tribal people and play a vital role in the life and economy of tribes living in the forest.

Ecological uses

Forests are habitat to all wild animals, plants and support millions of species. They help in reducing global warming caused by green house gases and produces oxygen upon photosynthesis. Forest can act as pollution purifier by absorbing toxic gases. Forest not only helps in soil conservation but also helps to regulate the hydrological cycle.

Aesthetic values

All over the world people appreciate the beauty and tranquillity of the forest because forests have a greatest aesthetic value. Forest provides opportunity for recreation and ecosystem research.

Over exploitation of forests

Forests contribute substantially to the national economy. With increasing population increased demand of fuel wood, expansion of area under urban development and industries has lead to over exploitation of forest .At present international level we are losing forest at the rate of 1.7 crore hectares annually. Overexploitation also occurs due to overgrazing and conversion of forest to pastures for domestic use.

Deforestation

Forest are burned or cut for clearing of land for agriculture ,harvesting for wood and timber , development and expansion of cities .These economic gains are short term where as long term effects of deforestation

Deforestation rate is relatively low in temperate countries than in tropics If present rate of deforestation continues we may losses 90% tropical forest in coming six decades

For ecological balance 33% area should be under forest cover but our nation has only 20.6% forest cover. e irreversible

Causes of deforestation

Shifting cultivation or jhum cultivation This practice is prevalent in tribal areas where forest lands are cleared to grow subsistence crops. It is estimated that principle cause of deforestation in tropics in Africa, Asia and tropical America is estimated to be 70, 50, and 35% respectively. Shifting cultivation which is a practice of slash and burn agriculture are posses to clear more than 5 lakh hectares of land annually. In India, shifting cultivation is prevalent in northeast and to limited extent in M.P, Bihar and Andhra Pradesh and is contributing significantly to deforestation.

Commercial logging It is a important deforestation agent. It may not be the primary cause but definitely it acts as secondary cause, because new logging lots permits shifting cultivation and fuel wood gatherers access to new logged areas.

c) Need for fuel wood Increased population has lead to increasing demand for fuel wood which is also acting as an important deforestation agent, particularly in dry forest.

d) Expansion for agribusiness With the addition of cash crops such as oil palm, rubber, fruits and ornamental plants, there is stress to expand the area for agribusiness products which results in deforestation.

e) Development projects and growing need for food The growing demand for electricity, irrigation, construction, mining, etc. has lead to destruction of forest. Increased population needs more food which has compelled for increasing area under agriculture crops compelling for deforestation.

f) Raw materials for industrial use Forest provides raw material for industry and it has exerted tremendous pressure on forest. Increasing demand for plywood for backing has exerted pressure on cutting of other species such as fir to be used as backing material for apple in J&K and tea in northeast states.

WATER RESOURCES

Water resources are sources of water that are potentially useful. Uses of water include agricultural, industrial, household, recreational and environmental activities. The majority of human uses require fresh water. 97% of the water on the Earth is salt water and only three percent is fresh water; slightly over two thirds of this is frozen in glaciers and polar ice caps. The remaining unfrozen fresh water is found mainly as ground water, with only a small fraction present above ground or in the air. Fresh water is a renewable resource, yet the world’s supply of ground water is steadily decreasing. The depletion is occurring most prominently in Asia, South America and North America. The framework for allocating water resources to water users (where such a frame-work exists) is known as water rights.

Surface water and Ground water use and over exploitation

Surface water is water in a river, lake or fresh water wetland. Surface water is naturally replenished by precipitation and naturally lost through discharge to the oceans, evaporation, evapo transpiration and groundwater recharge. Although the only natural input to any surface water system is precipitation within its watershed, the total quantity of water in that system at any given time is also dependent on many other factors. These factors include storage capacity in lakes, wetlands and artificial reservoirs, the permeability of the soil beneath these storage bodies, the runoff characteristics of the land in the watershed, the timing of the precipitation and local evaporation rates.

All of these factors also affect the proportions of water loss. Human activities can have large and sometimes devastating impact on these factors. Humans often increase storage capacity by constructing reservoirs and decrease it by draining wetlands. Humans increase runoff quantities and velocities by paving areas and channelizing the stream flow. The total quantity of water available at any given time is an important consideration. Some human water users have an intermittent need for water. For example, many farms require large quantities of water in the spring, and no water at all in the winter.

To supply such a farm with water, a surface water system may require a large storage capacity to collect water throughout the year and release it in a short period of time. Other users have a continuous need for water, such as a power plant that requires water for cooling. To supply such a power plant with water, a surface water system only needs enough storage capacity to fill in when the average stream flow is below the power plant’s need. Nevertheless, over long term, the average rate of precipitation within a watershed is the upper bound for average consumption of natural surface water from that watershed. Natural surface water can be augmented by importing surface water from another water-shed through a canal or pipeline. It can also be artificially augmented from any of the other sources; however, in practice the quantities are negligible.

MINERAL RESOURCES-USE AND EXPLOITATION

Use and Exploitation A mineral is pure, inorganic substance that occurs naturally in the Earth’s crust. All of the Earth’s crust, except the rather small proportion of the crust that contains organic material, is made up of minerals. Some minerals consist of a single element such as gold, silver, diamond (carbon), and sulphur. Minerals provide the material used to make most of the things of industrial – based society: roads, cars, computers, fertilizers, etc. Demand for minerals is increasing world wide as the population increases and the consumption demands of individual people increase. The mining of earth’s natural resources is, therefore accelerating, and it has accompanying environmental consequences.

More than two-thousand minerals have been identified and most of these contain inorganic compounds formed by various combinations of the eight elements (O, Si, Al, Fe, Ca, Na, K, and Mg) that make up 98.5% of the Earth’s crust. Industry depends on about 80 of the known minerals. A mineral deposit is a concentration of naturally occurring solid, liquid, or gaseous material, in or on the Earth’s crust in such form and amount that its extraction and its conversion into useful materials or items are profitable now or may be so in the future. Mineral resources are non renewable and include metals (e.g. iron, copper, and aluminum) and non-metals (e.g. salt, gypsum, clay, sand, phosphates). Minerals are valuable natural resources that are finite and non-renewable. They constitute the vital raw materials for many basic industries and are a major resource for development. therefore, Management of 18 mineral resources has, to be closely integrated with the overall strategy of development; and exploitation of minerals is to be guided by long-term national goals and perspectives.

Environmental effects of mineral extraction

The scale and level of requirement of minerals have increased manifold in our country and it is heading towards the stage where much larger consumption of minerals will be inevitable to sustain even the minimum growth rate of our economy. It is pertinent to note that out of the total land area of the country (3.29 million sq.kms),the area leased out of mining, as on 1-9-94, was 7126.13 sq.kms. Comprising about 9,213 mining leases, excluding atomic 19 minerals, minor minerals, petroleum and natural gas, this constitutes only about 0.25 per cent of the geographic area of the country and that including atomic minerals and minor minerals it may be around 0.28 per cent of the total area

FOOD RESOURCES

Food is usually of plant or animal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism’s cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth. Historically, humans secured food through two methods: hunting and gathering and agriculture. Today, the majority of the food energy required by the ever increasing population of the world is supplied by the food industry. Food safety and food security are monitored by agencies like the International Association for Food Protection, World Resources Institute, World Food Programme, Food and Agriculture Organization, and International Food Information Council. They address issues such as sustainability, biological diversity, climate change, nutritional economics, population growth, water supply, and access to food. The food resources are a composite of the goods (the foodstuffs) and the services in commerce and distribution through which these are made available for consumption.

World Food Problems

Food is essential to survive. There are three degrees of hunger: acute, chronic, and hidden. Famine is caused by food shortage and the inability of people to obtain food. It is usually caused by low food production resulting from drought, other factors, or it could be a result of the inability of a country or its population to afford to buy food. Every year, 15 million children die of hunger. It is estimated that 925 million people in the world do not have enough to eat. The WHO estimates that one-third of the world population is well-fed, one third is under-fed and one-third is starving. There are many factors that have contributed in making food security one of the most important global issues.

An increasing population wants a more varied diet, but trying to grow more food on less land with limited access to water, all the time facing increased costs for fertilizer, and fuel for storage and transport poses great problems for which there are no easy solutions. The available water is decreasing at an alarming rate. This warns us that there is not going to be enough water on the agricultural land that is needed for producing enough food in order to feed the projected population of 9 billion people by 2050. Also, the food prices have skyrocketed in the past few years making it difficult for average earners to afford a three course meal. These effects are witnessed in developing countries that rely heavily on imported food, such as North Africa, Latin America, and Middle East.

Currently, the world food situation is being defined by some new driving forces. These include climate change, globalization, urbanization, energy prices, and income growth as they are responsible in transforming food production, consumption and markets. The security of food in the world depends from the available food supply, the income of the targeted population, accessibility of food, food consumption rate, as well as the amount that can be stocked for future use.

MODULE-3

ECOSYSTEMS

CONCEPT OF AN ECOSYSTEM

An ecosystem is an area whose environment is unique and recognizable. Natural ecosystems include forests, grasslands, deserts, wetlands such as ponds, rivers, lakes, and the sea. Man-modified ecosystems include agricultural patterns, and patterns of urban or industrial land use. The ecosystem’s existence is based on its geographical features, such as hills, mountains, plains, rivers, coastal areas or islands. Climatic conditions such as the amount of sunshine, temperature, and rainfall also influence it.

The living portion of the ecosystem is called its biotic component and abiotic component is its non-living portion. All the living organisms in an area live in communities of plants and animals. They interact with their abiotic environment and with each other. Living organisms cannot survive without their non-living environment as this provides food and energy for the former’s survival, Thus, the biotic population and its environment work to create a natural self-sufficient unit known as an ecosystem. Ecosystems are the very base of life itself.

Definition of an ecosystem: A natural functional ecological unit comprising of living organisms (biotic community) and their non-living (abiotic or physio chemical) environment that interact to form a stable self-supporting system.

Ecosystems are divided into terrestrial or land-based ecosystems and aquatic ecosystems.

These form the two major habitat conditions for the Earth’s living organisms.

Stability of ecosystems

Many ecosystems are relatively stable and less influenced by some degree of human perturbation. Some are weak and quickly destroyed by human activity. Eg: Mountain ecosystems are extremely fragile, because degradation of forest cover contributes to significant soil erosion and changes in river courses. Island ecosystems are also 38 easily affected by human activity which can contribute to the rapid extinction of many of their unique plant and animal species. Some species may have a significant impact on the environment if eliminated. These are called ‘keystone species’. Extinction is caused by land-use changes and other geographical changes. Forests are deforested for timber, wetlands are drained to create more agricultural land and semi-arid grasslands are turned into irrigated fields. The pollution from industries and the waste from urban settings can also lead to poisoning and extinction of several species.

STRUCTURE AND FUNCTIONS OF AN ECOSYSTEM

The concept of ecosystem was first put forth by A.G. Tansely in 1935. Ecosystem is an essential unit of ecology. It has both structure and function. The structure is related to species diversity. The more complex the structure, the greater the species diversity within the ecosystem. The functions of an ecosystem are related to energy flow and materials cycling through structural components of the ecosystem. Every ecosystem has two key components from the structural perspective: Abiotic and Biotic

Abiotic components

The non-living factors or the physical environment prevailing in an ecosystem form the abiotic components. They have a significant impact on the structure, distribution, behavior and inter-relationship of organisms. Abiotic components are primarily of two types:

Climate Factors which include rain, temperature, light, wind, humidity etc.

( b)Edaphic Factors which include soil, pH, topography minerals etc.

The functions of important factors in abiotic components are given below: Soils are much more complex than simple sediments. They contain a mixture of weathered rock fragments, highly altered soil mineral particles, organic matter, and living organisms. Soils provide nutrients, water, a home, and a structural growing medium for organisms. The vegetation found growing on topsoil is closely linked to this component of an ecosystem through nutrient cycling. The atmosphere provides carbon dioxide for photosynthesis and oxygen for respiration for the organisms found within ecosystems.

The processes of 39 evaporation, transpiration and precipitation cycle water between the atmosphere and the Earth’s surface. Solar radiation is used in ecosystems to heat the atmosphere and to evaporate and transpire water into the atmosphere. Sunlight is also necessary for photosynthesis. Photosynthesis provides the energy for plant growth and metabolism, and the organic food for other forms of life. Most living tissues are composed of a very high percentage of water, up to and even ex-ceeding 90%. The protoplasm of a very few cells can survive if their water content drops below 10% of their saturation level and most are killed if it is less than 30-50% below the saturation level. Water is the medium by which mineral nutrients enter and are trans-lo-cated in plants. It is also necessary for the maintenance of leaf turgidity and is required for photosynthetic chemical reactions. Plants and animals receive their water from the Earth’s surface and soil. The original source of this water is precipitation from the atmosphere.

Biotic Components

The living organisms including plants, animals and micro-organisms (Bacteria and Fungi) that are present in an ecosystem form the biotic components. From nutrition point of view, the biotic components can be grouped into two basic components: (i)Autotrophic components and (ii) Heterotrophic components The autotrophic components include all green plants which fix the radiant energy of sun and manufacture food from inorganic substances. The heterotrophic components include non-green plants and all animals which take food from autotrophs. On the basis of their role in the ecosystem, the biotic components can be classified into three main groups:

(A)Producers (B) Consumers (C) Decomposers or Reducers

(A)Producers : Green plants have chlorophyll with the help of which they trap energy and change it into chemical energy of carbohydrates using simple inorganic compounds, namely, water and carbon dioxide. This process is known as photosynthesis. As the green plants manufacture their own food they are known as Autotrophs (i.e. auto=self, trophos= feeder). The chemical energy stored by the producers is utilized partly by the producers for their own growth and survival and the remaining is stored in the plant parts for their future use.

(B) Consumers :

Animals lack chlorophyll and are unable to synthesize their own food. Therefore, they depend on the producers for their food. They are known as heterotrophs (i.e. heteros= other, trophos= feeder). The consumers are of four types, namely:

(a) Primary Consumers or First Order Consumers or Herbivores: These are the animals which feed on plants or the producers. They are called herbivores. Eg: rabbit, deer, goat, cattle etc.

(b) Secondary Consumers or Second Order Consumers or Primary Carnivores: The animals which feed on the herbivores are called the primary carvivores. Eg: cat, fox, snake etc.

(c) Tertiary Consumers or Third Order Consumers: These are the large carnivores which feed on the secondary consumers. E.g. wolf.

(d) Quaternary Consumers or Fourth Order Consumers or Omnivores: These are the largest carnivores which feed on the tertiary consumers and are not eaten up by any other animal: Eg: lion and tiger.

(C) Decomposers or Reducers :

Bacteria and fungi belong to this category. They breakdown the dead organic materials of producers (plants) and consumers (animals) for their food and release to the environment the simple inorganic and organic substances produced as byproducts of their metabolisms. These simple substances are reused by the producers resulting in a cyclic exchange of ma-terials between the biotic community and the abiotic environment of the ecosystem. The decomposers are known as Saprotrophs (i.e., sapros=rotten, trophos=feeder).

FUNCTION OF AN ECOSYSTEM

In any ecosystem we have the following functional components:

(i)Inorganic constituents (air, water and mineral salts)

(ii)Organisms (plants, animals and microbes) and

(iii)Energy input which enters from outside (the sun)

FOOD CHAINS, FOOD WEBS AND ECOLOGICAL PYRAMIDS

In the ecosystem, green plants alone are able to trap solar energy and convert it into chemical energy. The chemical energy is locked up in the various organic compounds, such as carbohydrates, fats and proteins, that are present in the green plants. Since virtually all other living organisms depend upon green plants for their energy, the efficiency of plants in any given area in capturing solar energy sets the upper limit to long-term energy flow and biological activity in the community

The food manufactured by the green plants is utilized by themselves and also by herbivores. Herbivores fall prey to some carnivorous animals. In this way, one form of life supports the other form. Thus, food from one trophic level reaches the other trophic level and in this way a chain is established. This is known as the food chain.

Food chains are of three types:

1.\ Grazing food chain

The grazing food chain starts from green plants (autotrophs) and from them, it goes to herbivores (primary consumers) to primary carnivores (secondary consumers) and then to secondary carnivores (tertiary consumers) and so on. The gross production of a green plant in an ecosystem may be utilized in three ways – it may be oxidized in respiration, it may be eaten by herbivorous animals and after the death and decay of producers it may be utilized by decomposers and finally released into the environment. In herbivores, the assimilated food can be stored as carbohydrates, proteins and fats, and transformed into much more complex organic molecules. As in autotrophs, the energy in herbivores also meets three routes-respiration, decay of or-ganic matter by microbes and consumption by the carnivores Likewise, when the secondary carnivores or tertiary consumers eat primary carnivores, the total energy assimilated by primary carnivores or gross tertiary production follows the same course and its disposition into respiration, decay and further consumption by other carnivores is entirely similar to that of herbivores.

2.\ Parasitic food chain

It goes from large organisms to smaller ones without outright killing as in the case of predator.

3.\ Detritus food chains:

50 The dead organic remains including metabolic wastes and exudates derived from grazing food chain are generally termed detritus. The energy contained in detritus is not lost in ecosystem as a whole; rather it serves as a source of energy for a group of organisms called detritivores that are separate from the grazing food chain. The food chain so formed is called detritus food chain

FOOD WEB

Many food chains exist in an ecosystem, and they are not independent. In an ecosystem, one organism does not depend wholly on another. The resources are shared specially at the beginning of the chain. The marsh plants are eaten by variety of insects, birds, mammals and fishes and some of the animals are eaten by several predators. Similarly, in the food chain

eg: grass→mouse → snakes→owls.

Sometimes mice are not eaten by snakes but directly by owls. This type of interrelationship interlinks the individuals of the whole community. In this way, food chains become interlinked. A complex of interrelated food chains makes up a food web. Food web maintains the stability of the ecosystem. The greater the number of alternative pathways, the more stable is the community of living things.

Ecological Pyramids

The idea of ecological pyramids was advanced by C.E. Eltron (1927). The trophic structure of an ecosystem can be indicated by means of ecological pyramid. At each step in the food chain, a considerable fraction of the potential energy is lost as heat. As a result, organisms in each trophic level pass on lesser energy to the next trophic level than they actually receive. This limits the number of steps in any food chain to 4 or 5. The longer the food chain, the lesser is the energy available for the final members on the chain. Because of this taper-ing off of available energy in the food chain, a pyramid is formed and this is known as the ecological pyramid. The higher the steps in the ecological pyramid, the lower will be the number of individuals and the larger their size.

BIODIVERSITY AND ITS CONSERVATION

Introduction:

It is really amazing , if we divide the whole mother earth into 10 billion parts, it is only one part where life exists and the surprising variety of living organisms which could be about 50 million species are all restricted to just about a kilometer –thick layer of soil, water and air. It is indeed wonderful to see that so much diversity has been created by nature on this earth from so little physical matter. Biodiversity refers to the variety and variability among all groups of living organisms and the ecosystem complexes in which they occur. Biodiversity constitutes the biological wealth.

Importance of biodiversity

Biodiversity conservation, the practice of protecting and preserving the wealth and variety of species, habitats, ecosystems, and genetic diversity on the planet, is important for our health, wealth, food, fuel, and services we depend on. Biodiversity conservation is vital for economic growth and poverty reduction.This has created a great imbalance in nature. Thus, the importance of biodiversity has to be understood and actions have to be taken to maintain all the three levels of diversities.

Biogeographic Classification of India :

India is country of vast biodiversity. It is divided into different regions based on the geography, climate and pattern of vegetation seen and the communities of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, insects and other invertebrates that live in them. Each of these regions contains a variety of ecosystems such as forests, grasslands, lakes, rivers, wetlands, mountains and hills, which have specific plant and animal species. Biogeographic classification of India is the division of India according to biogeographic characteristics. Biogeography is the study of the distribution of species (biology), organisms, and ecosystems in geographic space and through geological time. There are ten biogeographic zones in India.

Trans Himalayan zone.

Himalayan zone

Desert zone.

Semiarid zone.

Western Ghat zone.

Deccan plateau zone.

Gangetic plain zone. 61

North east zone.

Coastal zone.

Islands present near the shore line

Trans-Himalayan region

The Himalayan ranges immediately north of the Great Himalayan range are called the Trans- Himalayas. The Trans-Himalayan region with its sparse vegetation has the richest wild sheep and goat community in the world. The snow leopard is found here, as is the migratory black-necked crane.

Himalayas

The Himalayas consist of the youngest and loftiest mountain chains in the world. The Himalayas have attained a unique personality owing to their high altitude, steep gradient and rich temperate flora. The forests are very dense with extensive growth of grass and evergreen tall trees. Oak, chestnut, conifer, ash, pine, deodar are abundant in Himalayas. There is no vegetation above the snowline. Several interesting animals live in the Himalayan ranges. Chief species include wild sheep, mountain goats, ibex, shrew, and tapir. Panda and snow leopard are also found here.

Semi-Arid Areas

Adjoining the desert are the semi-arid areas, a transitional zone between the desert and the denser forests of the Western Ghats. The natural vegetation is thorn forest. This region is characterized by discontinuous vegetation cover with open areas of bare soil and soil-water deficit throughout the year. Thorny shrubs, grasses and some bamboos are present in some regions. A few species of xerophytic herbs and some ephemeral herbs are found in this semi-arid tract. Birds, jackals, leopards, eagles, snakes, fox, buffaloes are found in this region.

Western Ghats

The mountains along the west coast of peninsular India are the Western Ghats, which constitute one of the unique biological regions of the world. The Western Ghats extend from the southern tip of the peninsula (8°N) northwards about 1600 km to the mouth of the river Tapti (21°N). The mountains rise to average altitudes between 900 and 1500 m above sea level, intercepting monsoon winds from the southwest and creating a rain shadow in the region to their East. The varied climate and diverse topography create a wide array of habitats that support unique sets of plant and animal species. Apart from biological diversity, the region boasts of high levels of cultural diversity, as many indigenous people inhabit its forests.

North-West Desert Regions

This region consists of parts of Rajasthan, Kutch, Delhi and parts of Gujarat. The climate is characterized by very hot, dry summer and cold winter. Rainfall is less than 70 cm. The plants are mostly xerophytic. Babul, Kikar, wild palm grows in areas of moderate rainfall. Indian Bustard, a highly endangered bird is found here. Camels, wild asses, foxes, and snakes are found in hot and arid deserts.

Deccan Plateau

Beyond the Ghats is Deccan Plateau, a semi-arid region lying in the rain shadow of the Western Ghats. This is the largest unit of the Peninsular Plateau of India. The highlands of the plateau are covered with different types of forests, which provide a large variety of forest products. The Deccan plateau includes the region lying south of the Satpura range.it extends up to the southern tip of peninsular India. Anaimudi is the highest peak of this region.The Deccan plateau is surrounded by the Western and the Eastern Ghats. These Ghats meet each other at the Nilgiri hills. The Western Ghats includes the Sahyadri, Nilgiris, Anamalai, and cardamom hills. Many rivers such as Mahanadi, Godavari, Krishna, and Kaveri originates from Western Ghats and flow toward the east.The Eastern Ghats are broken into small hill ranges by river coming from the Western Ghats. Most of these rivers fall into the bay of Bengal.The Godavari is the longest river in the Deccan plateau .Narmada and the Tapi flow westwards and fall into the Arabian sea.

Gangetic Plain

In the North is the Gangetic plain extending up to the Himalayan foothills. This is the largest unit of the Great Plain of India. Ganga is the main river after whose name this plain is named. The aggradational Great Plains cover about 72.4mha area with the Ganga and the Brahmaputra forming the main drainage axes in the major portion. The thickness in the alluvial sediments varies considerably with its maximum in the Gangetic plains. The physio geographic scenery varies greatly from arid and semi-arid landscapes of the Rajasthan Plains to the humid and per-humid landscapes of the Delta and Assam valley in the east.

North-East India

North-east India is one of the richest flora regions in the country. It has several species of orchids, bamboos, ferns and other plants. Here the wild relatives of cultivated plants such as banana, mango, citrus and pepper can be grown.

Islands

The two groups of islands, i.e., the Arabian Sea islands and Bay Islands differ significantly in origin and physical characteristics. The Arabian Sea Islands (Laccadive, Minicoy, etc.) are the foundered remnants of the old land mass and subsequent coral formations. On the other hand, the Bay Islands lay only about 220 Km.

Coasts

India has a coastline extending over 5,500 km. The Indian coasts vary in their characteristics and structures. The west coast is narrow except around the Gulf of Cambay and the Gulf of Kutch. In the extreme south, however, it is somewhat wider along the south Sahyadri. The backwaters are the characteristic features of this coast. The east coast plains, in contrast are broader due to depositional activities of the east-flowing rivers owing to the change in their base levels. Extensive deltas of the Godavari, Krishna and Kaveri are the characteristic features of this coast. Mangrove vegetation is characteristic of estuarine tracts along the coast for instance, at Ratnagiri in Maharashtra. Larger parts of the coastal plains are covered by fertile soils on which different crops are grown. Rice is the main crop of these areas. Coconut trees grow all along the coast.

Value of Biodiversity

As all the organisms in an ecosystem are interlinked and interdependent, the value of biodiversity in the life of all the organisms including humans is enormous.

Loss of biodiversity contributes to climatic change.

Forest converts carbon dioxide into carbon and oxygen. Loss of forest covers due to release of carbon dioxide and other gases due to industrialization, contributes to ‘Green House Effect’. This leads to Global warming which results in raise in sea-level submerging the low-lying areas in the world and causing atmospheric changes.

Biological diversity is also essential for preserving ecological processes.

Tribal communities who directly gather resources from the forest or fisher folk who catch fish in marine or freshwater ecosystems are directly or indirectly linked to the biological variety present in the biosphere.

For agricultural communities, biodiversity is used to grow their crops to suit the environment.

Urban communities generally use the greatest amount of goods and services, which are all indirectly drawn from natural ecosystems.

Preservation of biological resources is essential for the well-being and long-term survival of mankind.

Types of conservation

In situ conservation :

Faced with the conflict between development and conservation, many nations find it unrealistic and economically not feasible to conserve all their biological wealth. Invariably, the number 71 of species waiting to be saved from extinction far exceeds the conservation resources available. On a global basis, this problem has been addressed by eminent conservationists. They identified for maximum protection, certain ‘biodiversity hotspots’ regions with very high levels of species richness and high degree of endemism (that is, species confined to that region and not found anywhere else). Although all the biodiversity hotspots put together cover less than 2 percent of the earth’s land area, the number of species they collectively harbour is extremely high and strict protection of these hotspots could reduce the ongoing mass extinctions by almost 30 per cent. In India, ecologically unique and biodiversity-rich regions are legally protected as biosphere reserves, national parks and sanctuaries. India now has 14 biosphere reserves, 90 national parks and 448 wildlife sanctuaries. India has also a history of religious and cultural traditions that emphasized protection of nature. In many cultures, tracts of forest were set aside, and all the trees and wildlife within were venerated and given total protection. Such sacred groves are found in Khasi and Jaintia Hills in Meghalaya, Aravalli Hills of Rajasthan, Western Ghat regions of Karnataka and Maharashtra and the Sarguja, Chanda and Bastar areas of Madhya Pradesh. In Meghalaya, the sacred groves are the last refuges for a large number of rare and threatened plants.

Ex situ Conservation :

In this approach, threatened animals and plants are taken out from their natural habitat and placed in special setting where they can be protected and given special care. Zoological parks, botanical gardens and wildlife safari parks serve this purpose. There are many animals that have become extinct in the wild but continue to be maintained in zoological parks. In recent years ex situ conservation has advanced beyond keeping threatened species in enclosures. Now gametes of threatened species can be preserved in viable and fertile condition for long periods using cryopreservation techniques, eggs can be fertilised in vitro, and plants can be propagated using tissue culture methods. Seeds of different genetic strains of commercially important plants can be kept for long periods in seed banks. Biodiversity knows no political boundaries and its conservation is therefore a collective responsibility of all nations. The historic Convention on Biological Diversity (‘The Earth Summit’) held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, called upon all nations to take appropriate measures for conservation of biodiversity and sustainable utilisation of its benefits. In a follow-up, the World Summit on Sustainable Development held in 2002 in Johannesburg, South Africa, 190 countries pledged their commitment to achieve by 2010, a significant reduction in the current rate of biodiversity loss at global, regional and local levels.

Every heartbeat matters—and so does the team monitoring it.

As the rates of heart diseases and cardiac disorders due to lifestyle-related factors continue to rise, the need for competent cardiac care technologists has never been greater. If you are enthusiastic about healthcare and desire a career that is technical, practical, and instrumental in saving lives, then B.Sc.

This program integrates comprehensive medical science with on-the-job hospital training, getting students ready to assist cardiologists in diagnosing and treating cardiovascular conditions. It’s not just a class—it’s a career built on compassion and accuracy.

What is B.Sc. Cardiac Care Technology?

B.Sc. Cardiac Care Technology is an undergraduate course of 3 years (with 1 year internship) that educates students in the operation, diagnosis, and maintenance of cardiac care technologies. Students learn to use ECG machines, aid in catheterizations, handle patients during cardiac procedures, and read important reading under clinical supervision.

At Noida International University, however, things go a notch higher by blending classroom toughness with early exposure to hospitals, resulting in graduates being job-confident from day one.

NIU Flags Off Student Recruitment Exercise in African Countries

Noida International University (NIU) is known to be one of the preferred destinations for international students seeking quality education in India. Ever since the university came into existence, its primary endeavour has been to facilitate international students with desired course curriculum, diverse learning environment and dynamic teaching pedagogy.

Keeping in mind India’s external economic policy, special emphasis is given to the African countries. Once again, to make students aware of the efforts put in by NIU to facilitate African students with the desired level of education, our International Admissions Team helmed by Ms. Alkananda (Dy. Director Admissions and International Relations) visited Lusaka, Zambia. Accompanying her on this highly important mission was Ms. Sheeradeep Kaur (Manager International). From February 27 to March 3, both the members of the International Admissions Team conducted a student recruitment exercise with the local representatives to increase visibility, networking and collaboration with associate partners for student outreach. The team interacted with students from various cities of Zambia.

During the team’s stay in Zambia, they conducted various seminars and found that students of Zambia were quite interested in the Allied Health Sciences and Engineering programmes offered by Noida International University.

After every session, a Q&A session was also conducted in which the floor was open for students to ask questions related to eligibility criteria and scholarships offered by NIU.

Career Options After Pursuing Law

Exploring Law as a Career Option after pursuing 5 Years integrated Course after 10+2 or 3 Years of LLB

After completing 12th, many students pursue a career in the law sector. It is the most popular degree that comes with good pay and a lot of opportunities. One can work as a practitioner lawyer or opt for higher study after completing law.

Law education has become the most common choice in India at the moment. It has evolved and grown tremendously throughout time. According to the preference, students have the option to choose between a three-year law course following graduation or a five-year law course after the 12th. Previously, it was considered that studying law limits one to the courtroom, but opportunities have grown. Individuals can now seek careers as litigation, corporate, or commercial lawyers, judges, and patent attorneys.

LL.B. stands for Legum Baccalaureus, which means Bachelor of Laws is a UG degree pursued by students seeking a career in law. Graduates of the LLB program are eligible to serve in three of the government’s primary bodies – Legislature, Executive, and Judiciary. With an LLB degree, you can have access to ample opportunities that other professions. This is why a law degree can offer doors to employment that other degrees may not.

What is the Future of Indian Legal Profession?

In India, the legal profession has evolved considerably over time. Law professionals are not only confined to the courtroom representing their clients but are also working in corporate enterprises, IT companies, administrative services and law firms.

Lawyers in India are not restricted to the three branches of government: legislature, executive, and judiciary. With continuous changes in the law, it is critical for businesses to seek legal assistance that can address evolving demands in a variety of business areas. So let us have a look at some of the best and most promising LLB career options.

Best Career Options after LLB degree

The career options will expand once you have completed your law degree, which might be a simple LLB or a five-year BBA LLB or BA LLB program. Listed below are the top 10 career opportunities for a Bachelor of Law graduate.

Top Career Options after LLB in India

Advocate

Advocacy is one of the most sought-after careers for LLB graduates to choose from. Students who choose this pathway to get the chance to practice in the District Court, High Court of the state, and the Central Supreme Court. But it is important for aspirants to clear the All India Bar Council examination in order to qualify for their practice.

To become a good advocate, one must first work as a junior assistant to a senior advocate. It entails drafting papers and researching cases. This gives them a fresh outlook on the law. So, after learning the law, they would be ready to work as an independent lawyer.

Legal Advisor

It is the best LLB career path you can choose in terms of the variety of opportunities available. A legal advisor can provide advice on various legal matters to the corporate sector, firms, organizations or individuals. They help their clients in drafting contracts, legal papers, and resolving disputes. A legal advisory has to pass the bar exam after graduating from law school and also needs a state license to practice this profession.

Corporate Counsellor or Lawyer

Corporate legal firms provide incredible opportunities for recent law graduates. It is considered the most appealing field for lawyers and is regarded to be the most prominent field of law in India. These specialists can counsel corporate firms either as an employee or working as a full-time counsellor. A corporate lawyer makes sure that the organization complies with all applicable policies and regulations. He mainly deals with lawsuits or shareholder issues.

Government Services & Indian Armed Forces

Students with L.LB are also recruited for Indian legal services and various other posts such as Legislative counsel in the Legislative department and Legal advisors in the Department of Legal Affairs. Also, the Legislative Department of India has a separate official language division for Legislative Counsels, available in Hindi and other regional languages.

The selected candidates also have a choice to get a career in the Indian Army, Air Force, and Navy. They conduct disciplinary hearings and court-martials for defaulting army personnel in accordance with the law.

5 Legal Outsourcing

Legal outsourcing is a term that refers to a practice in which a law firm obtains legal services from an external firm. If the outsourced entity is from another country, it is called off sharing. This is another area where the potential has not been completely realized. There are countless opportunities for the country’s people in this industry.

Private Firm

The private sector is constantly brimming with new work opportunities as a result of its enormous and rapid growth. Law graduates may join these private companies located around the country after completing his/ her law degree. They may serve as Corporate or Legal Advisors to any private organization, helping them in making legal decisions. The requirement for a law graduate in all private sector firms is becoming increasingly significant.

Judiciary

This is a great option for LLB graduates to choose if they want to play a major part in administrative affairs. They may work as a Judge or Magistrate for the country. However, students must devote a significant amount of time to preparing for competitive examinations. The applicant must hold an LLB degree from a recognized university and a maximum age of 35 to be eligible for these posts.

Magistrate/Munsif or Sub-Judge Posts are filled by new recruits through the Public Service Commission or by High Court supervision. A Magistrate leads all the criminal cases whereas civil ones are decided by the Sub Judge or Munsif. These officials can be promoted to District Judges and based on seniority further proceeded to High Court and Supreme Court.

Higher Education

If you want to specialize in a particular area of law, you have various options for further higher law studies. After graduation, pursuing an L.LM or MBA can help you to better understand the connection between business and law.

Legal Publishing and Journalist

Many lawyers work in the media industry, including print media such as newspapers and magazines, as well as electronic media such as news channels. They play an important role in educating the public about legal services such as annual government bills, transfer of funds to various sectors, huge investments by businessmen, and their influence on the economy. A lawyer who works in the media clarifies these complex issues for the general public.

Teaching

Students with a strong academic record and at least a Master’s or Ph.D. are more likely to be considered for positions at the country’s most prestigious universities or law schools. There is considerable opportunity for visiting lecturers, as private universities are mushrooming and choose such individuals for their brilliance and insight. In this manner, you can also become a professor at public or private universities.

Some Other Career Options to Choice after Law

Aside from these popular career options for law graduates, applicants may also take an unorthodox path after graduation. Students can apply their legal knowledge in a variety of different professional environments. Some of these non-traditional career options have been listed below.

Human Rights

Public Welfare

Politics

Social Work

Policy Development

Law has a bright future since the market will continue to grow in need for legal competence. The salary varies according to the profiles and their roles and responsibilities. Finally, the choice is entirely up to your personal preferences and interests.

Salary Pay & Benefits

Salary pay in the law profession varies and depends on the career path you choose. In government sector, you gets the additional advantages aside from the basic wage. Government employees in India enjoy a generous salary and benefits. Whereas occupation in private sectors is also remarkable.

Why Law is a popular career option?

Law is one of the most popular career choices in our country from a very long time especially for those whose families have been into this profession for generations but this ideology is changing and those who do not have a family of lawyers are opting for law because of the wide career option gates that law has opened. All you need to have is the passion to study law.

Diverse career opportunities available

Earlier people just compartmentalized law into civil law and criminal law, which has changed, and there has been an immense rise in the specializations like IPR, Corporate Law, Business Law, International Economic Trade law etc. offered by Law Schools and Universities. A degree in law not only lets you practice as a lawyer in the courts or work in an MNC but also opens up career options in sectors like corporate management, legal services, administrative services and armed forces. The diverse career options that a law degree offers is unmatched by any other professional degree. Law is a multi-disciplinary endeavor and it draws from other disciplines, for instance a criminal lawyer needs to have some understanding of human psychology and forensic science, and a corporate lawyer must have some understanding of commerce and capital.

How to choose the favorable course?

Students interested in making a career in law can either do a three-year law course from top law schools in Gurgaon after graduation in any discipline or a 5 years integrated law (BA LL.B) after 12th class. Many Universities have now introduced BBA LL.B and BSc LL.B as well. The Bar Council of India, which sets rules, regulates the LLB course and regulations regarding legal practice in the country and a higher degree in law is regulated by University Grant Commission (UGC). Higher degrees like LL.M and PhD in Law can help one pursue a career in academics. There are so many Law Colleges in Delhi NCR recognized by the Bar Council of India offering 5 year integrated B.A. LLB/BBA LL.B/BSc LLB/B.Com LLB.

A candidate can start preparing for the entrance exam either in Class XI or Class XII. Students aspiring to do law from National Law Schools have to appear for CLAT (Combined Law Admission Test) which tests them on their general English, Legal Aptitude, Logical Reasoning, General Awareness and Elementary Mathematics.

There are a plethora of opportunities for a law graduate like practicing in the Courts, Judicial Services, UPSC, Armed Forces, Academics, NGOs, Legal Editor, Legal Journalist, Legal Advisor for MNCs, legal officers for Banks and Insurance Companies, LPOs, KPOs, Armed Forces (Judge Advocate General) etc.

Conclusion

The law field provides an ample of opportunities, however it is necessary to align your passion and career goals in order to be successful. Be well-informed about your possibilities and make an informed decision before deciding on a career route. A lot of career options are waiting after your LLB degree.

Happy Reading

Wish you all the Best!!!

Print

Radio

Films

Digital Media

OTT

Social Media

Although in recent times the media and entertainment industry has grown some offshoot branches in the form of Animation, Gaming, Live Events, Music etc. It was a distant past that only television, print and radio. After the coming of the internet and digitalization and with the coming of android based mobile phones, the scenario has changed drastically. The so-called palm-based technology has made the media and entertainment industry more competitive. The introduction of app-based media has also driven the content to be more precise and meaningful. One of the most important parts of the media and entertainment industry is advertising. It is the backbone of all the commercial activities of the media sector. Without advertising, it would be impossible for any medium of media to survive.

Television

The introduction of terrestrial transmission in the form of private TV channels consisting of entertainment and news channels has begun a new era. Before the coming of private TV channels, there was only Doordarshan, as it is controlled and managed by the government. So there was a meaning of competition at that time. After 1992, there were a few channels namely ZEE TV, Sony TV and Star TV. There was very little competition at that time and with the time follows, the no. of channels so is the competition.

As per the industry estimates released by the Broadcast India 2018 Survey conducted by Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) India, out of a total of 298 million households in India, around 197 million households have TV sets which are being served by cable TV services, DTH services, HITS services, IPTV services, in addition to a terrestrial TV network of Doordarshan.

Following trends can be seen in the Television in the recent times:

Content Visibility- The TV channels may not able to catch up with their viewers due to their busy schedules and lifestyle. The TV serials have repeat telecast and it is available on YouTube also.

Growing No. of Channels- With the introduction of Internet TV, the no. of TV channels has gone up in recent times.

Constant growth in no. of households having a TV.

The TV industry is going towards a boom level with the entire stakeholder trying to reach the end viewers.

Youth viewership has also gone up in recent times.

The regional genre is also driving both revenue and viewership in the TV industry in India.

Print

The first newspaper was published in Kolkata popularly known as Hickey’s Gazette. The print media industry in India has travelled a long way in India. The print media industry consists of not only newspapers but magazines, books, journals, reports etc. In recent times the print media has gone through a change in terms of both content and presentation. Most Indians start the day with a daily newspaper compared to the western model where people buy newspapers on the daily basis from stands or metro stations.

The Indian print media industry has grown phenomenally over the past few years. Most of the newspapers and magazines are in Hindi and their circulation is also large no. as compared to English publications.

Following trends can be seen in the Print media industry in the recent times:

The cost of the publications has gone down as compared to the past.

Rise vernacular press has also risen in recent times. Publications like Eenadu and Malayala Manorama give us ample reasons to believe.

Local content about political and Socio-cultural issues is being addressed in the publications.

Advertisement revenue has also gone up in the print media industry, particularly in Hindi and vernacular press.

Increased literacy rates have also contributed to the rise of print media. Although readers for English publication has gone down a bit in the recent times.

There is stiff competition from the digital platform. As a result, the publications have started their editions digitally, making it easier for the readers to read.

Radio

In India, the radio was started by All India Radio (AIR) in the 1950s. Because of its reach, the radio has a reach of about 99% in India. The radio industry is a very small part of the broadcasting universe. At Rs. 2,300 crores, the Radio industry comprises about 5% of the broadcasting sector in India. It has a very modest market share which makes it non-viable for its players in the market.

Following trends can be observed in the Radio industry in the recent times:

FM Radio stations have extended to B-level cities like Agra, Coimbatore etc.

Because of its access FM has developed as on the go media.

Radio has become strong in terms of effective ad campaigns with a high recall value and expansive reach.

The growth of Community Radio helps in addressing local issues and helps in creating awareness.

New trends have come in the form of RJs turning into celebrities.

Another interesting trend is that interesting show formats including sports, folk culture, trivia, technicalities of music-making and more, have opened a world of insightful entertainment and have been on the rise.

Radio has come up as a platform for making music popular.

Radio extended with the advent of the digital era, radio has expanded its footprint to reach out to its extended target audience.

Films

Films in India have always been a mirror of society. The Indian film industry is the biggest in the world in terms of the production of films. They distract us from our monotonous problems by diverting our attention to the visuals and in the process often extracting emotions or providing relaxation, thereby entertaining us. They also allow social interaction by providing an opportunity to discuss common topics of interest. More often than not we relate to the characters of the movie, thus creating a sense of connection and sometimes even reinforcing our values. Movies intensify some aspects of life such as comedy, romance, war etc. It plays the role of the magnifying glass and it is a platform to quench curiosity about a serious subject.

Following trends can be witnessed in the coming times in India’s film industry:

Movies with more realistic themes are made to capture the audience’s attention.

India’s film industry in the coming times will not depend on theatrical releases, films soon will get the same or a large number of audiences on OTT platforms as well.

The risk of the film being at a financial loss will also be minimized with other means of release like OTT available.

The film industry has become an organized sector with the introduction of the Producer’s Guild, Cine Artist Association and other associations of workers like light men, spot boys etc.

The opening of multi-screen theatres also paved the way for the business to grow.

Online booking through apps also helps in the growth of the film industry in India.

Digital Media

The digital media industry in India has become the most important platform. There is a big debate in the initial stages between electronic and print media and who owns it. Electronic media says that it is seen on a screen so it belongs to them. On the other hand, print media believes that the content is in print form so it will be in print media. Then in the 2000s, there was the starting of content showing on the computer. Does the question arise what is digital media?

Digital media is digitized content that can be transmitted over the internet or computer networks. This can include text, audio, video, and graphics. This means that news from a TV network, newspaper, magazine, etc. that is presented on a Web site or blog can fall into this category. We should also know what constitutes digital media.

There are 3 types of digital media:

Owned Media : Any online asset that you control like your website or social media channels.

Paid Media : Promoting your online content to improve traffic to your owned media assets.

Earned Media : Customer’s recommendation by word of mouth or through social media 4 .

The following trends can be seen in the digital media industry in India:

There will be a considerable rise in mobile streaming.

New demographic content has also come up in the form of vernacular media.

There has been a shift from consumer to creator. Instagram and Facebook have given rise to this shift.

Due to the availability of low-cost internet, the users of digital media have risen to manifolds.

The flip side of the digital revolution is increased piracy.

OTT (Over The Top)

OTT or in full Over The Top media. Over the top (OTT) refers to film and television content provided via a high-speed Internet connection rather than a cable or satellite provider. It is a bit newer media which is fast becoming the rage, especially among youngsters. OTT content can be accessed directly on a computer, but it is often watched on a Web-enabled television or through an Internet-enabled device. OTT content can be accessed directly on a computer, but it is often watched on a Web-enabled television or through an Internet-enabled device.

Netflix and Amazon Prime are OTT platforms that have gained prominence in recent times. Nowadays there are newer apps like ZEE5, SONY LIV, MX Player, HOTSTAR, VOOT, HUNGAMA, EROS NOW etc.

Following trends can be seen recently in OTT:

Subscription-based users have risen many times since its inception.

Films nowadays are released only on the OTT.

While only TV and movies were the two mediums artists could enter, digital content has opened opportunities.

The next stage of the OTT revolution is a battle to gain supremacy over the Indian market by foreign players.

Social Media

One of the most important contributions of technology in the media sector is social media. Social media is one sphere which has changed the dynamics of how we see media and communication. It has amalgamated all the things on one single platform. The introduction of android based mobile has revolutionized social media. It gives users endless opportunities to express themselves.

With the ease of internet access, the number of active social media users in India stood at 330 million in 2019 and it is expected to reach 448 million by 2023.

The entry of WhatsApp into India’s digital market boosted app usage , with a doubling in rural areas in recent years. Data shows that the reach of the messaging service extends wider than just urban areas. Other popular apps include TikTok and Instagram.

The social video app TikTok has been a huge hit in India, it has reached 1.5 billion downloads worldwide on the App Store as well as Google Play and India leads the chart with 466.8 million or about 31% of all unique installs. Prominent social media apps include Twitter, Watsapp, Facebook, Instagram, Tinder, Helo etc.

Smartphones are increasingly becoming the primary screen for Indian customers, which means, the smartphone and its applications become the principal source of news for about 35% of the country’s internet users, a majority of whom use one or more social networks .

Rural India has 264 million internet users and this is expected to reach 304 million in 2020. Rural India has a sizable portion that is devoid of internet access. Thus, there is immense headroom for growth which will contribute to an increase in the overall internet population over the next few years.

Following trends can be observed in the social media:

Brands re-evaluating the metrics that matter most.

More advanced dynamic and direct ads in social media.

Use of artificial intelligence.

App-based on total privacy and security.

Social media will be a new platform for subject-specific ads.

News based content is the new entrant on social media

Way Forward

The presence of modern communication technologies has made the world a global village where anybody can have access to anything, anywhere. We are ushering into a new era of global communication. We can fight and create awareness of diseases like HIV/AIDS or in recent times Corona Pandemic. The epic rise in the proportion of media especially the new media and social media has created a lot of opportunities to interact. The media and entertainment industry is riding a horse which is galloping with a whirling speed. More innovations will make the media and entertainment industry in India more competitive and will also create job opportunities

Expanding Horizons Through Progressive Learning

Education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today. -Malcolm X

Life has more to offer than we can ever comprehend. A layman thinks that opportunities around us are limited, only a few of us can avail the luxuries of life and rest of the humanity will have to live in the setup of society which seems and feels reasonable for people with limited resources. Well, if we see the big picture, we will get to know that these kinds of minuscule thoughts only add to our disappointment and misery.

Breaking the chain of monotonous thoughts and middle-class mentality is really necessary. Reaching for Sun-like Icarus is important while keeping the sanity of our thoughts and awareness of the current state in mind.

How can we break the monotony of thoughts? What all measures should a layman take to become extraordinaire?

The answer is the Progressive Learning approach. Our current education system works on the principle of rote memorization so that a student can pass the exams with flying colors and join the band of hypocritic minds who do not think about the impact of their decision and follow the crowd programmed to live a monotonous life.

To build a better society, we need skilled professionals who are learned enough to execute a task with ease but also are good human beings. Professionals who do not only rely on bookish knowledge and numbers but have a diverse thought process which helps them to navigate through the nitty-gritty of life and bring about a change which impacts society as a whole. A society where financial and social equality is achieved not through theatrical extravaganzas, but through empathy, harmony and tranquillity.

The Progressive Learning approach has become a scarce practice in our current education system. Only a few institutions are following this approach and one such temple of knowledge is Noida International University (NIU).

Noida International University was established in 2010 with a motive to provide quality education and a diverse learning environment to domestic as well as international students. The University endeavours to position itself as the beacon of world-class education on the global educational landscape.

We, at NIU, believe that it is the duty of an educational institution to produce trained professionals who can act as the catalyst for social change. To achieve this feat, dynamic teaching pedagogy and the modern learning process has been forced into effect. Students, irrespective of the course they have opted for, are encouraged to expand their thinking process by bringing down their mental barriers which forces them to mug up the course material rather than motivating them to use their critical-thinking ability and bring on the table multiple solutions to a particular problem which earlier has only one traditional solution.

In my view, educational institutions all across the country should adopt the progressive learning approach to shape the future of the younger generation in an effective way.

What MBA teaches you?

Many professionals believe that obtaining an MBA degree helps individuals step forward in their careers. Regardless of the business or area of professional specialisation, an MBA may help individuals succeed. However, considering the time and money investment, some people may ask if an MBA is worthwhile.

In the present VUCA world, having knowledge of the most prominent leadership techniques and business practises are considered critical to success. Furthermore, Managers or executives in any industry are also required to be able to look at the bigger picture and be able to visualize for the forthcoming trends. Experts opine that this knowledge doesn’t come merely with on-the-job experience, it requires individuals to undergo specialised degree programs designed for the purpose.

MBA is one such program wherein the course curriculum is designed to provide the foundation of business knowledge.  It is a highly transferable degree with many topics in the curriculum that may be used to a variety of career options. It is a two years degree program wherein the first year is often comprised of core courses that teach students the fundamentals of general management. These classes provide a solid basis on which to construct a particular skill set. Later on, in the second year, the curriculum offers specialization electives — that will go further into a certain sector or business. The program offers dual specialization in which the students are free to choose courses from two different specializations.

The program develops a greater sense of confidence in students and enhances their level of the knowledge thereby making them ready to take on the challenges of the corporate world. The program offers fundamental business and management skills that will be beneficial in whatever sector or profession that the student chooses to pursue. The program offers numerous benefits to students like career counselling, analytical skills, long-term strategic thinking, alumni networking, increased prospective wages, and many more. Getting an MBA degree displays a dedication to learning, growing, and applying abilities that may help a firm prosper.

WHAT IS USER INTERFACE (UI)? HOW IT IS IMPORTANT?

The User Interface (UI) refers to a product/service's visual and interactive
                                    elements, that
                                    are
                                    used by the user to interact with the application to complete a task or achieve a
                                    particular
                                    goal. The UI includes all the visible on-screen elements, such as buttons, menus,
                                    text, and
                                    images, as well as the layout and design of these elements. The goal of UI design is
                                    to
                                    create
                                    an interface that is visually appealing, easy to navigate, and intuitive for the
                                    user. The
                                    UI is
                                    a vital aspect of the user experience (UX), as it directly impacts how the user
                                    interacts
                                    with a
                                    product and their overall satisfaction with the experience. The UI is essential
                                    because it
                                    serves as the primary point of interaction between users and digital products or
                                    systems. A
                                    visually appealing and consistent UI can help build trust and reinforce a brand's
                                    values and
                                    personality, while a poorly designed UI can lead to confusion, frustration, and user
                                    abandonment.
                                    Therefore, a well-designed UI is crucial to providing an optimal user experience,
                                    which in
                                    turn
                                    can lead to increased engagement, retention, and user satisfaction.
                                    and
                                    requirements of your project or organization. You can create new components or
                                    modify
                                    existing ones to better suit your needs.

WHAT IS A DESIGN SYSTEM?

The design system is a digitalized library of ready-to-use components and core
                                    features that promote and simplify collaboration among various designers and
                                    developers. It comes with a step-by-step guide for designing and coding the
                                    application. The reusable components that eliminate duplication of effort and save
                                    time. The assets include a pattern library and framework that designers and
                                    developers can use to work more efficiently and improve the end user experience.

National e-Governance Division

In 2009, the National e-Governance Division was created by the Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology as an independent business division under the Digital India Corporation (erstwhile Media Lab Asia), a Section 8 not-for-profit company. Since 2009, NeGD has been playing a pivotal role in supporting MeitY in programme management and implementation of e-Governance projects, providing technical and advisory support to ministries/departments, both at central and state levels, along with other government organisations.

India Stack Global has been launched to showcase the India Stack and its building blocks globally.

Entity Locker is a pioneering addition to the DigiLocker family, a cornerstone initiative of the Digital India campaign.

This is a user authentication service in which a single set of credentials provides access to multiple online applications or services.

Launched by the Hon’ble Prime Minister, myScheme is a marketplace for schemes.

API Setu is an Open API Platform from the Ministry of Electronics and IT, Government of India.

An initiative under the Digital India Programme prioritizes users’ needs by implementing a citizen-centric approach to User Experience (UX).

The objective of the OpenForge platform is to promote the sharing and reuse of e-governance application source code.

UMANG is a unified portal aggregating major citizen-centric services of central and state governments, local, autonomous & statutory bodies through mobile apps (Android & iOS) and the web.

Targeted at the idea of paperless governance, DigiLocker is a platform for the issuance and verification of documents & certificates digitally, thus eliminating the use of physical documents.

Answers  to  questions  asked  during  'Ask  our  Experts'  YouTube 

Live Show on DigiLocker on October 18, 2024 

Question  1:  What  should  I  do  if  there  is  a  name  mismatch  between  my 

Aadhaar and my degree certificates? 

Example: 

Aadhaar Name: Given Name + Father’s Name + Surname/Family Name 

Degree Certificate Name: Surname/Family Name + Given Name + Father’s 

Name 

Answer: As you may be aware, DigiLocker requires matching your name to 

ensure  that  only  the  rightful  owner  can  access  their  documents.  For  a 

document to be fetched from DigiLocker, the name on the document must 

match the name on your Aadhaar. In case of a name mismatch, you will not 

be able to pull your document from DigiLocker.  

Question 2: If I have an account with one mobile number linked to Aadhaar 

and  my  Driving  Licence  is  linked  to  another  number,  can  I  retrieve  my 

Driving Licence in my current DigiLocker account? 

Answer: Yes, you can log in to your DigiLocker account linked with Aadhaar 

on  the  DigiLocker  website  (www.digilocker.gov.in).  Use  the 

'Search 

Document'  option  on  the  left,  select  'Ministry  of  Road  Transport  and 

Highways,'  click  on  'Driving  Licence  Verification  Record,'  and  enter  your 

licence number to retrieve it. 

1 

 
 
 
 
 
Question 3: When will the Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) ID be functional 

in all government institutes? 

Answer:  The  Ministry  of  Education  (MoE)  aims 

to  complete 

the 

implementation of ABC across all government institutes soon. The process 

is underway to ensure seamless access for students nationwide. 

Question 4: Why do I see the message "school students should contact their 

respective schools" when trying to create my APAAR ID? 

Answer: Students under the age of 16 cannot create their APAAR ID directly 

through the DigiLocker app or website. If you are eligible and still face issues, 

please reach out to your school for assistance in creating your APAAR ID. 

Question 5: What should I do if my 12th Mark Sheet has not been uploaded 

on DigiLocker by my college? 

Answer:  Only  the  authorized  board  or  university  can  upload  data  on 

DigiLocker. If your 12th Mark Sheet is missing, please contact your board and 

request them to make the data available on DigiLocker. 

Question  6:  Why  aren’t  my  state’s  educational  documents  like  10th  &  12th 

Mark Sheets or degree certificates, available on DigiLocker? 

Answer: Digital records are available on DigiLocker only if the institution has 

uploaded  its  records  to  the  National  Academic  Depository  (NAD).  If  your 

documents are missing, please contact your university or board and request 

them to provide their digital records on NAD for access via DigiLocker.

Question  7:  Can  we  trust  that  our  data  and  privacy  are  safe  on  the 

DigiLocker digital cloud? Is there legal protection against hacking? 

Answer:  DigiLocker  is  designed  with  robust  security  measures  to  ensure 

data and privacy protection. Key practices include: 

Standard  Security  Practices:  Adherence  to  coding  standards,  internal 

security reviews, and regular penetration testing. 

2048-Bit SSL Encryption: Ensures secure data transmission. 

Multi-Factor Authentication: Includes OTP, biometric, and PIN validation for 

sign-up and sign-in. 

ISO 27001 Certified Hosting: Data is stored in secure, certified facilities. 

Data Redundancy: Backups with multi-zone redundancy for data protection. 

Timed Log Out: Automatic session termination after inactivity. 

Security Audits: Conducted regularly by CERT-IN empanelled agencies and 

third parties. 

User Consent: Data is shared only with explicit user consent, and all access 

is logged. 

These  measures  ensure  that  DigiLocker  is  safe  and  legally  compliant, 

offering strong data protection for its users. 

Question 8: Hello, I graduated from RTU Kota in 2011 and completed my 10th 

and  12th  from  the  Rajasthan  Board.  How  can  I  get  my  digital  documents 

from the issuer on DigiLocker? 

Answer:  Digital  records  are  available  on  DigiLocker  only  if  the  issuing 

institution  has  uploaded  its  records  to  the  National  Academic  Depository 

(NAD).  To  access  your  documents  digitally,  please  contact  the  Rajasthan 

Board and RTU Kota, requesting them to provide their records on NAD.

Question 9: After uploading my class results data at Sangam University, I 

noticed that the generated grade sheets are not organized in any sequence 

by enrolment number or ABC ID. What should I do? 

Answer:  Please  raise  a  ticket  at  https://support.digilocker.gov.in/  and 

provide the following details: 

A scanned copy of the mark sheet/certificate or your full name as it appears 

on the document 

Education board name 

Year of passing/session/month 

Roll number/registration number/seat number 

Serial number on the document 

Total marks 

Your registered mobile number 

A screenshot of the error 

Providing these details will help the support team address and resolve the 

issue. 

Question 10: I received a discrepancy error during the upload of results in 

DigiLocker due to a name mismatch between my Aadhaar and the name 

submitted. How can I resolve this issue? 

Answer:  DigiLocker  requires  matching  of  name  to  ensure  that  only  the 

rightful  owner  can  access  their  documents.  The  name  on  your  document 

must match the name on your Aadhaar. To resolve this discrepancy, you will 

need to update either your Aadhaar or the name on the document to ensure 

they match. Once corrected, you should be able to access your document 

from DigiLocker. 

4 

 
 
 
 
 
Question 11: Is it mandatory to upload documents on DigiLocker, or can we 

upload data on ABC and have it automatically visible on DigiLocker? This 

question pertains to student records, such as degree certificates. 

Answer: No, it is not mandatory to upload documents directly on DigiLocker. 

Data  uploaded  on  the  Academic  Bank  of  Credits  (ABC)  will  be  visible  on 

DigiLocker if it is seeded with the ABC or APAAR ID. This ensures that students 

can access their records seamlessly through DigiLocker.

classes, but I can't get these documents on DigiLocker.

2014-2021  and  2023.  You  may  request  them  to  make  earlier  records 

available. 

Question 14: How can we add an SSC certificate from 1991 to DigiLocker?

Question 16: How can DigiLocker help in making Digital India paperless, and 

when can we expect to see this transformation? 

Answer: DigiLocker is a key driver of a paperless Digital India by providing a 

secure and accessible platform for storing, sharing, and accessing official 

documents as mentioned below: 

Digital Document Storage:  Securely  store  government-issued  documents 

like  Aadhaar,  licenses,  and  certificates,  eliminating  the  need  for  physical 

copies. 

Instant  Access  &  Sharing:  Access  and  share  documents  anytime, 

anywhere, streamlining processes and reducing paper dependency. 

Government  Services  Integration:  Receive  and  store  digital  government 

documents such as pension papers and health records, minimizing paper 

workflows. 

6 

 
 
 
 
Paperless Verification: Secure, online document verification eliminates the 

need for physical submissions, enhancing efficiency. 

Environmental & Cost Benefits: Reduces paper waste, cuts costs, and saves 

time in document storage and processing. 

DigiLocker  is  accelerating  the  shift  towards  a  paperless  India,  supporting 

both  environmental  sustainability  and  administrative  efficiency.  As  for  the 

timeline,  the  continued  integration  of  services  and  awareness  efforts  will 

pave the way for a more paperless society in the coming years. 

Question 17: What are the benefits of DigiLocker, and is it mandatory for all 

citizens of India? 

Answer: DigiLocker offers numerous benefits, including: 

Secure Storage: Users can securely store and access important documents 

like Aadhaar, driving license, and educational certificates in digital format, 

eliminating the need for physical copies. 

Simplified  Sharing: 

It  simplifies  document  sharing  with  government 

departments and businesses, ensuring authenticity and reducing the risk of 

fraud. 

Integration with Government Services: DigiLocker is integrated with various 

government  services,  providing  convenient  access  and  saving  time  for 

users. 

Enhanced Security: It offers secure storage through encryption, multifactor 

authentication,  and  regular  audits,  ensuring  that  your  documents  are 

protected. 

Please note that DigiLocker is not mandatory for all citizens of India; it is an 

optional  service  designed  to  enhance  convenience  and  security 

in 

document management. 

7 

 
 
 
 
 
Question  18:  If  there  is  a  name  mismatch  between  my  Aadhaar  and  my 

university  certificates  (e.g.,  my  B.Sc.  and  M.Sc.  certificates),  how  can  I 

retrieve these certificates in DigiLocker? 

Answer:  Please  note,  in  cases  of  a  name  mismatch,  you  won’t  be  able  to 

fetch documents from DigiLocker. The name on the document must match 

the name on your Aadhaar. Please reach out to your institution if you need 

further guidance on updating your name. 

Question 19: Foreign students who are currently enrolled—what assistance 

can  be  provided  to  help  them  register  for  an  APAAR  ID  without  Aadhaar 

details? 

Answer:  We  are  in  the  process  of  establishing  a  procedure  for  creating 

APAAR  IDs  specifically  for  foreign  students.  Further  guidelines  and  support 

will be made available soon to facilitate their registration without Aadhaar 

details. Please stay tuned for updates regarding this process 

Question  20:  As  students  are  advised  to  have  DigiLocker,  can  we  create 

multiple accounts using a single mobile number? 

Answer:  Yes,  users  can  create  up  to  five  Aadhaar-verified  DigiLocker 

accounts  using  a  single  mobile  number.  However,  only  one  non-verified 

DigiLocker  account  can  be  created  with  the  same  mobile  number.  This 

system  allows  flexibility  in  managing  multiple  DigiLocker  accounts  while 

ensuring security and proper authentication through Aadhaar verification.

Question  21:  Foreign  students  currently  enrolled  at  Sangam  University—

what  assistance  can  be  provided  to  help  them  register  for  an  APAAR  ID 

without Aadhaar details? 

Answer:  Please  raise  your  query  at  https://nad-support.digilocker.gov.in/.

DigiLocker documents.

that all software must go through testing?

including uniform coding standards, guidelines, and reviews. Each release is

deployment.   

24 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Question 82: I am from Motihari, LND College. I have created my account on 

DigiLocker, but only my Aadhaar card is downloading; other certificates like 

my 10th and 12th certificates are not available.

name,  passing  year,  session,  roll  number,  registration  number,  and  other 

details so we can assist further.   

Question  83:  Most  students  face  issues  in  generating  ABC  IDs  through

on the ABC website.

Question 85: Sikkim Manipal University enrolls foreign students. How can we 

help them register for an APAAR ID without Aadhaar?   

Answer: Please raise your query at [https://nad-support.digilocker.gov.in/] 

(https://nad-support.digilocker.gov.in/). We are working on a procedure for 

creating APAAR IDs for foreign students.   

25 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Question  86:  Many  students  are  unsure  if  a  DigiLocker  certificate  can  be 

submitted for admission or job purposes instead of the original one.   

Answer:  DigiLocker-issued  digital  documents  are  valid  and  equivalent  to 

originals when used electronically. They should be accepted by concerned 

authorities,  and  we  are  working  to  increase  awareness  and  acceptance 

among organizations.   

Question 87: By knowing a person’s ABC ID, can someone access their other 

documents?   

Answer:  No,  knowing  the  ABC/APAAR  ID  alone  does  not  provide  access  to 

other documents.   

Question 88: What is the process for transferring a student’s credits from 

one university to another during a course?   

Answer:  Credit  transfer  between  universities  follows  the  National  Credit 

Framework (NCrF) norms. 

Question 89: What should I do if my 12th mark sheet is not uploaded by my 

college on DigiLocker? 

Answer: Once your board uploads your data on DigiLocker, you will be able 

to retrieve your digital documents from the platform. 

Question 90: How safe is DigiLocker if my mobile phone is stolen? 

Answer: Kindly set an MPIN for your DigiLocker account. To do this, log in to 

the DigiLocker app, tap "Menu" at the bottom of the screen, go to "Settings," 

select "Security," and set your 4-digit MPIN. 

26 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Question 91: How does DigiLocker encourage private companies to accept 

digital documents for KYC processes? 

Answer:  Digital  documents  issued  via  DigiLocker  are  legally  valid  and 

equivalent to physical originals when used electronically. We actively work 

with  various  organizations  to  increase  awareness  and  promote  the 

acceptance of these digital documents. 

Question  92:    If  Aadhaar  is  not  mandatory,  how  does  DigiLocker  ensure 

security for user authentication? 

Answer:  DigiLocker  uses  multifactor  authentication  based  on  document 

validation for authenticating users. To protect citizens’ accounts, the system 

only  permits  access  when  names  on  Aadhaar  and  DigiLocker  documents 

match exactly. This ensures rightful ownership of documents. 

Question 93: Does the Gateway in DigiLocker access or store user data? 

Answer: The Gateway in DigiLocker acts as a secure intermediary, enabling 

document transmission and exchange between DigiLocker and authorized 

organizations without accessing or storing user data. 

Question  94:  Can  the  same  document  exist  in  both  the  'Issued'  and 

'Uploaded' sections on DigiLocker? 

Answer:  Yes,  the  same  document  can  exist  in  both  sections.  The  Issued 

Documents  section  contains  digitally  signed,  legally  valid  documents 

directly  from  authorized  issuers,  while  the  Uploaded  Documents  section 

(DigiLocker Drive) is personal storage for digitized copies. We recommend 

using documents from the Issued Documents section for official purposes. 

27 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Question 95:  Why  is  manual  upload  of  certificates  still  required  for  some 

competitive exams and university admissions? 

Answer: Digital documents issued through DigiLocker are legally valid and 

equivalent  to  original  documents  when  used  electronically.  However, 

DigiLocker  is  working  to  increase  awareness  and  acceptance  of  these 

documents with various organizations. 

Question 96: Is DigiLocker data shared or sold to third parties? 

Answer:  DigiLocker  only  acts  as  a  secure  intermediary  for  document 

transmission  between  DigiLocker  and  authorized  organizations.  When 

accessed  via  third-party  applications,  documents  are  shared  only  with 

verified online consent. 

Question  97:    Why  are  there  both  APAAR  and  ABC  IDs,  and  is  there  a 

difference? 

Answer: APAAR and ABC IDs refer to the same unique ID, with the Ministry of 

Education renaming the ABC ID to APAAR ID. You can use your APAAR ID for 

all academic-related activities. 

Question  98:    What  is  DigiLocker’s  approach  to  software  security  during 

testing? 

Answer:  DigiLocker  follows  standard  software  development  practices, 

including uniform coding standards, guidelines, and reviews. Every release 

undergoes thorough internal review and testing for security and penetration 

vulnerabilities before deployment. 

28 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Question 99:  Can DigiLocker certificates be submitted for admissions or job 

applications instead of original ones? 

Answer: Digital documents from DigiLocker are legally valid as per the IT Act 

2000  and  equivalent  to  original  documents  when  used  electronically. 

However,  we  are  working  to  increase  awareness  and  acceptance  of  such 

documents. 

Question 100:  How do I change my mobile number in DigiLocker? 

Answer: First, link your new mobile number to your Aadhaar. Afterward: 

  1. Sign in with your mobile number and security PIN. 

  2. Click "Try using Aadhaar OTP instead" at the bottom of the page. 

  3. Enter the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-registered mobile number. 

  4. After logging in, go to the profile section and edit your mobile number. 

  5. Enter your new number and verify with OTP. 

Question 101:  If a student’s name is missing on the ABC ID, how can it be 

resolved? 

Answer:  If  the  student  is  not  using  Samarth,  they  can  complete  eKYC  in 

DigiLocker, which should update the name to match the Aadhaar name. 

Question 102:  Can DigiLocker help prevent fake certificates and degrees? 

Answer:  Digital  documents  issued  via  DigiLocker  are  legally  valid  and 

equivalent  to  physical  originals  when  used  electronically.  Organizations 

using DigiLocker’s services can validate documents online, while others may 

still require paper copies. 

29 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Question 103: If an institution uploads an incorrect grade sheet, can it be re-

uploaded with the correct data?   

Answer: Yes, documents can be updated only by the issuing authority. 

Question  104:  How  can  I  use  my  linked  ABC  card  and  DigiLocker  to  take 

courses from other institutions?   

Answer:  ABC  provides  academic  credit  deposit  accounts  for  students  in 

recognized Higher Education Institutes (HEI). Academic credits earned are 

automatically  credited  to  your  account,  which  can  be  accumulated  and 

redeemed  for  academic  programs  at  any  time,  enabling  you  to  pursue 

courses across different institutions. 

Question  105:  My  Aadhaar  name  changed  after  marriage,  but  my  credit 

mark sheet has my previous name, so my documents aren’t uploading to 

DigiLocker. Is there a solution?   

Answer: In cases of name mismatches, DigiLocker cannot fetch documents. 

The name on your document must match the name on your Aadhaar. 

Question  106:  If  a  student  leaves  their  course  mid-session  due  to  some 

issue, does the ABC card help?   

Answer: Yes, credits earned can be saved in the student’s ABC account, and 

they can redeem these credits if they resume their education later. 

Question  107:  Is  Aadhaar  the  only  document  required  for  DigiLocker 

verification?   

Answer:  Aadhaar  eKYC  is  mandatory  for  fetching  documents  in  your 

DigiLocker account. 

30 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Question 108: I’m unable to create my APAAR ID despite multiple attempts; 

what can I do?   

Answer:  Students  under  the  age  of  16  cannot  create  their  APAAR  ID  via 

DigiLocker. For assistance, please contact your school. 

Question  109:    Are  documents  in  DigiLocker  encrypted,  like  WhatsApp’s 

end-to-end encryption?   

Answer: Yes, DigiLocker uses high standards for privacy and data security, 

with encryption at rest and in transfer to protect and secure all data. 

Question 110:  Why doesn’t DigiLocker show the full Aadhaar number?   

Answer: For security reasons, UIDAI issues Digital Aadhaar in this format. For 

more details, please contact UIDAI directly. 

Question 111: If my Aadhaar card does not have a mobile number, how can 

I open a DigiLocker account?   

Answer: Link a new mobile number to your Aadhaar at the nearest Aadhaar 

Enrolment Center, as DigiLocker requires an OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked 

mobile number. 

Question 112: Are DigiLocker and APAAR ID the same, or are they different?   

Answer: DigiLocker and APAAR ID are different but integrated to provide a 

secure way to store and access academic documents. 

31 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Question  113:  Are  there  any  fees  for  creating  an  APAAR/ABC  ID  through 

DigiLocker or other portals?   

Answer: There  are  no  charges  associated  with  creating  an  APAAR/ABC  ID 

through DigiLocker, ABC, or UDISE portals. 

Question 114: How can we upload mark sheets for students with arrears who 

complete later semesters?   

Answer:  Separate  mark  sheets  can  be  uploaded  by  the  institution  for 

students in such cases. 

Question 115: How can academic researchers contribute to the DigiLocker 

project?   

Answer:  Academic  researchers  can  provide  feedback  and  suggestions 

through  the  DigiLocker  support  portal,  which  may  help  enhance  the 

platform. 

Question 116:  शादी के  बाद लड़!कयQ का नाम आधार मX बदल जाता है ले !कन माक( शीट 

मX पुराना नाम होता है, ऐसे मX डॉCूमXwस अपलोड नह, होते हW।   

Answer: DigiLocker म( डॉXूम((cid:148)स को सही से फे च करने के  2लए नाम का 2मलान होना 

आवqक है। अगर आधार म( और डॉXूम((cid:148)स म( नाम का मेल नह(cid:128) होगा, तो डॉXूम((cid:148)स फे च 

नह(cid:128) )कए जा सक( गे। 

Question  117:  How  effective  is  DigiLocker  in  addressing  the  issue  of  fake 

documents, certificates, and degrees?   

Answer: DigiLocker authorizes agencies to access documents directly from 

the  owner’s  account,  and  documents  can  be  directly  uploaded  by 

authorized bodies, reducing the chances of fake documents.

Process Followed:

The rules of EXPRESSIONS- The Debating Club were:

The debate must be in English and Hindi.

Each team has two or three constructive speeches, and two to three rebuttal speeches. The affirmative gives the first constructive speech, and the rebuttals alternate: negative, affirmative, negative, affirmative. The affirmative has both the first and last speeches of the debate.

No new constructive arguments may be introduced in the rebuttal period. The affirmative must, if possible, reply to the major negative arguments before the last rebuttal.

In the questioning period, the questioner may ask any fair, clear question that has a direct bearing on the debate. The questioner may use the period to build up any part of his own case, to tear down any part of his opposition’s case, or to ascertain facts, such as the opposition’s position on a certain issue, that can be used later in the debate. The questioner must confine himself to questions and not make statements, comments, or ask rhetorical questions.

Dr. Ruchika Gupta Director School of Business Management, Esteemed Judge addressed the students and declared the results thereafter.

The results of debating competition:

Winner: Sunika Adhikari- Department of International Relations, NIU.

1 st Runner up: Priyanshu Singh- Department of Political Science NIU.

2 nd Runner up: Avnish Upadhyay – Department of Political Science NIU

WHAT'S NEW

20 ways that we're celebrating two decades of YouTube

Pop the confetti, because YouTube is turning 20! From the
                      19-second clip that started it all, to now over 20 billion
                      uploaded videos,1 including music, Shorts, podcasts and
                      more, we've grown so much in just two decades.
                      We're kicking off our birthday with plenty of ways to
                      celebrate. Take a peek at some of our new features, stats,
                      hidden gems and easter eggs below to help you join in on
                      the festivities:

YouTube and industry leaders announce the Youth Digital
                      Wellbeing Initiative

A message from Neal Mohan, YouTube CEO: Today, YouTube is
                      pleased to join over a dozen regional content creators and
                      distributors representing ten countries to participate in
                      the Youth Digital Wellbeing Initiative, supporting a
                      unified vision for the development of high-quality,
                      age-appropriate content for young people.

From the YouTube CEO: Our big bets for 2025

This year marks YouTube's 20th birthday. In two
                      decades, YouTube has transformed culture through video and
                      built a thriving creative economy. Today's creators
                      have moved from filming grainy videos of themselves on
                      desktop computers to building studios and producing
                      popular talk shows and feature-length films. And people
                      aren't just watching YouTube on their computers or
                      phones. TV has surpassed mobile and is now the primary
                      device for YouTube viewing in the US (by watch time),1 and
                      according to Nielsen, YouTube has been number one in
                      streaming watch time in the US for two years.2 And while
                      it's still early days, AI is making a big difference
                      in how people create and consume content on YouTube.
